## Authoring Posts
1. Log in to [Prose](http://prose.io/) (which uses your GitHub account).
2. Visit [this project in Prose](http://prose.io/#danamcc/danamcc.github.io).
3. Click on "NEW FILE" to create a post or on an existing post to edit it.
4. Modify the title if you are creating a new post (where it says "Untitled").
5. Author the post in Markdown. The default text when creating a post is just for reference, remove it all before starting a new post.
6. The default category for all posts is "Life". If you want to change it to the other category ("Love"), go to metadata from the sidebar and select it in the dropdown menu.
7. In the sidebar, click save. You can then click "COMMIT" to save the post. If you are modifying an existing post, you should add a commit message explaining why you changed the post (for future reference).
8. By default, saving a new post will leave it unpublished, meaning that you will not see it on the website. To publish a post, click "Unpublished" in the toolbar, then save the post.
