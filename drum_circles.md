Rhythm has always been the most compelling and visceral aspect of music for me, and the sheer variety and power of rhythmic sounds has led me, on my own and with others, to explore the endless potential of various hand drums and percussion instruments to weave beautiful patterns that satisfy and soothe the body, heart, and soul.

In 2001, I was moved to begin a regular drumming practice in response to my own emotional stress from the World Trade Center attack, and I've been drumming with others in various community settings ever since, as a therapeutic, meditative, and recreational practice for my own well-being, and for the well-being of others.

Since then, I've facilitated drum circles in and around northern New Jersey for many different types of communities, including:

- schools
- youth groups
- veterans' groups
- religious congregations
- weddings
- private parties
- corporate events
- festivals
- the general public

It has become one of my primary life goals to promote community drumming as much and as far as I can, so that more and more people can experience the joy and well-being that participating in drum circles brings. Here's what some others in the drumming community have to say about this, along with some interesting research:

As a drum circle facilitator, my commitment is always to empower others to experience the joy of expressing their natural rhythmic spirit in a community environment, along with the healing, stress relief, and spiritual benefits that communal drumming promotes.

*My "Drumming Manifesto":*
{:.before-blockquote}

COMMUNITY IN RHYTHM
We are beings of energy, in a universe of energy.
It is our gift in each moment to direct that energy as we will.
In rhythm together, we direct that energy to our highest purpose,
For the greater joy and well-being of all.
{:.well.manifesto}
