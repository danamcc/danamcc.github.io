Rhythm has always been the most compelling and visceral aspect of music for me, and my love for the sheer variety of sounds and rhythms that man-made or found objects can produce has led me, over the years, to collect a wide range of hand drums, percussion instruments, and various other noise makers. 

In 2001, I was moved to begin a regular drumming practice as a response to my own emotional stress from the World Trade Center attack, and I've been drumming with others in various community settings ever since, as a therapeutic, meditative, and recreational practice for my own wellbeing and for the wellbeing of others. 

<p class="before-list">Since then, I've facilitated drum circles in and around northern New Jersey for many different types of communities, including:</p>

- schools
- youth groups
- veterans' groups
- religious congregations
- weddings
- private parties
- corporate events
- the general public 

My commitment as a drum circle facilitator is to empower others to experience the joy of expressing their natural rhythmic spirit in a community environment, along with the healing, stress relief, and spiritual benefits that communal drumming promotes. 

<p class="before-blockquote"><em>This is my "Drumming Manifesto":</em></p>

<div class="well manifesto">
  <h2>Community in Rhythm</h2>

  <p>
    We are beings of energy, in a universe of energy.<br>
    It is our gift in each moment to direct that energy as we will.<br>
    In rhythm together, we direct that energy to our highest purpose,<br>
    For the greater joy and wellbeing of all.
  </p>
