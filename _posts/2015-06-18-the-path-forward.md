All too often,
as we move through our lives,
We direct our attention
at obstacles we wish to avoid,
or objects of desire
we wish to pursue.

But the path forward,
back to our true nature,
can be found by following,
not these obstacles,
these objects of desire,
but rather,
the emptiness between them.
