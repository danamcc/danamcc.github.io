title: What we see 2

How much of what we see  
is clouded by the artifacts of seeing?  
  
For every missing pixel,  
how much is filled in  
by fear,  
or hope,  
or preconception?  
  
Only with an inner eye  
can we look  
at the forest AND the trees,  
the picture and the pixels.  
  
Only through this eye  
can we learn to see   
BOTH worlds,  
the inner and the outer.
