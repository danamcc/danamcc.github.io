It’s okay  
that you’re gone  
from this world.
{: .centered}

That space  
that you once filled  
is still alive  
with loving memories.
{: .centered}

But,  
at times like this  
I wish  
I could send a message,  
sharing this feeling  
of love  
ever-present.
{: .centered}

And with these words,  
I send it,  
and receive it,  
as well.
