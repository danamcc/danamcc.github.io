title: What Actually Happened

What if there was a "news" site 
that presented the rumours, opinions, 
and outright lies of each day 
as a quiz, with one item, 
interspersed among them, 
that actually happened? 

Could we train ourselves 
to recognize this ever-present useless, 
pernicious nonsense when we see it, 
if we felt motivated enough 
to look for it every day? 

Could we cure ourselves of the addiction 
to the adrenalin rush of feeling right, 
the seductive pull of affirmation bias, 
if we were inspired by the possibility 
of finding out the truth? 

Should we wait for the prodding 
of some enlightened soul's initiative,
spoonfed for our own internet enlightenment,
or should we take it upon ourselves 
to ferret out what is real, and what isn't, 
in this deluge of information 
that we are nearly drowning in each day?
