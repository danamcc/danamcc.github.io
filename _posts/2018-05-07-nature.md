Nature enlivens us,
and soothes us,
because it is a part of us
we have forgotten.

No matter how 
we separate ourselves,
ensconced in our edifices,
we are always part
of the world of Nature,
its unruly and dangerous 
children.

In our precociousness,
and in our greed,
we have tried too hard
to tame it.

Perhaps it is time
to let it tame us.
