Whatever I see  
Is already inside me,  
Or I would not see it.

All I experience  
Lives in this world inside,  
A universe without limit,  
Inside my flesh.

All I need,  
All I want,  
Is already here.

There is nothing "outside"  
Which isn't "inside".

"Inside" and "outside"  
are the same.

I am complete.
