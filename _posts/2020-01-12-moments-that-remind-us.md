There comes a time
when Eveready isnâ€™t ready,
and memory foam forgets.

These are the moments that remind us 
that entropy is the engine 
that runs our world,
and that things wind down,
by and by.

All our expectations 
are merely wistful dreams,
destined to dissolve
in the light of day,
when life gives us glimpses 
of its divine cycle,
of becoming and decay,
that gives life to everything
in its time.
