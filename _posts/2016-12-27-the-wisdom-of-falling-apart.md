We are born of Spirit,
with no shape,
like a blob of light.

As we walk through the world,
tourists in its worldy culture,
we collect its spare parts,
forming a frame around us,
a shield from threat and rejection,
held together with wire and tape,
the hope of being accepted.

It is like driving through life
in a junkyard car,
forever plugging the gaps
with rationalizations and deceptions,
ignoring the rattles and shakes
of encroaching entropy.

And there may come a time
when we grow weary
with the strain of grabbing
at its decaying seams,
and release our hold,
allowing timeâ€™s arrow to guide us, 
the wisdom of falling apart,
to be naked once again.
