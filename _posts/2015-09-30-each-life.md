Each life
is like a drop of water,
flowing from its source,
condensed into being,
and soon to evaporate,
or merge with the sea.

It is a precious jewel,
in its moment of existence,
in an infinite chain
of precious jewels.

Each one
is a universe itself,
a reflection,
in its moment,
of the Whole.

- D. McCurdy
