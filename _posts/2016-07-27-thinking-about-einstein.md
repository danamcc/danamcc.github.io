If God does not play dice
with the Universe,
does God play dice
with dice?

How can Creation
allow randomness
in one domain,
but not another?

Perhaps this universe
is just one stream
in an infinite flow
of universes,
in which everything
that could happen
does happen.

So, in any moment,
there are an infinite number
of paths we can choose,
and an infinite number
we canâ€™t.

And so,
there are always
infinite reasons for rejoicing,
and infinite reasons for regret,
and, always,
infinite choices
for moving on.
