title: This Dream of Aloneness
categories: life

What if the “I” that I think I am
is just imagining itself,
solidified by thinking,
again and again?

Is it by being this “I”
that I am cut off,
separated,
from all other “I’s”,
in this dream of aloneness?

What if each “I”
is but a drop
in an ocean of being?

Then,
beyond this dream,
there is no separation,
there is no “I”,
and, as we awaken,
we are not alone.
