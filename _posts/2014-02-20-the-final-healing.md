title: The Final Healing
category: life
---

Spirit,
perfect and eternal,
cannot be be broken.
Yet the body,
earthbound and ephemeral,
can.

Time and entropy
wear down the engine of flesh,
and there comes a moment
when life and being
can no longer be held
In its fragile frame.

It is then that the spirit
longs to be free,
bursting the bonds
of fleeting form.

Then,
in that moment
of release,
is not death
the final healing?
