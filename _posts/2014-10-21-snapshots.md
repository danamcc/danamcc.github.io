As the landscape around us comes and goes,  
so does the landscape within.

A radiant sky,  
or a soulful face,  
touches us,  
and we capture it   
in the memory of our machines,  
not trusting ourselves to keep it.

And those moments of freedom,  
mind blown by vivid experience,  
slip away, like water  
unless frozen into form,   
crystalized with words.

Life flows around us,  
through us,  
and we try our best to hold it in our hands,  
in a picture, an idea,  
if just for a moment.

These images remind us  
of what we were, 
what we were a part of,  
what we always are,  
even in our forgetfulness.
