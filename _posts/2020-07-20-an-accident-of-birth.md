title: An Accident of Birth

I am white and male
through an accident of birth,
and an American
through another accident of birth.

And I belong to this human family,
on this planet full of other sentient beings,
by yet another accident of birth.

And what we all have in common
is that every being on this planet 
has a right to be here,
that we are equal in God's eyes.

And our sacred duty
is to learn how to get along.
