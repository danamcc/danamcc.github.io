title: An Accident of Birth

I am white, and I am male
through an accident of birth,
and I am an American
through another accident of birth.

I am part of this human family,
on this planet full of other sentient beings,
by yet another accident of birth.

And what we all have in common
is that every being 
has a right to be here,
that we are equal in Godâ€™s eyes,
and so our sacred duty
is to learn how to get along.
