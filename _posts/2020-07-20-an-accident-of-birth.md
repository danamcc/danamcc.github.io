title: An Accident of Birth

I am white, and I am male
because of an accident of birth,
and I am an American
because of another 
accident of birth.

I am a member of this human family,
on this planet full of other sentient beings,
by still another accident of birth.

What we all have in common
is that we all have the right to be here,
that we are equal in Godâ€™s eyes,
and that it is our sacred duty
to learn how to get along.
