The mind
is our tool
for finding
what’s missing,
what’s wrong,
what needs fixing.

Always,
it seeks problems;
its thoughts -
the weapons
to vanquish them.

As it seeks and seeks,
it will find a problem
it cannot fix -
the busyness
of its own thinking,
the endless chain
of healing
the wounds
it has thought
into existence.

And it may see
its own complicity
(creating the obstacles
that stand in the way
of seeing),
and, in a moment of grace,
it may stand aside,
allowing us a glimpse
of our own perfection.
