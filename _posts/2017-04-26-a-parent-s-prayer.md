My hope for you
is not for you 
to become
who I think 
you should be.

Although I helped you
to come into this world,
it is up to you
to find your own way in it.

I have done my best
to keep you safe
until your own instincts
can protect and guide you.

My hope for you,
as you build a future
for yourself,
is that you greet it
as the gift it is,
and that you grow to be
the happiest, 
most fulfilled person
you are willing 
and able to be.
