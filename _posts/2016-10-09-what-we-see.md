As we look out at the world,
how much of what we see
is blurred and clouded
by the artifacts of seeing?

Through the mindâ€™s eye,
filtered and quantized,
do we only see
what we expect,
or can understand?

Do we look
as through a scanner,
darkly,
filling in
each missing pixel
with memory,
hope, or fear?

Or can we look more deeply,
seeing *how* we see,
the forest *and* the trees,
the picture and the pixels?

Only through this inner eye
can we learn to see
both worlds,
the world inside,
and the world around us.
