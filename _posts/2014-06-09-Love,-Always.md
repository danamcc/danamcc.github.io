"I will love you always"'  
can be true, always,  
because love exists  
outside of time.

And things change.  
Thoughts and feelings  
come and go.

love seems to disappear,  
when the mind rules,  
and the heart shuts down.

And, in each moment,  
there is a choice:  
to re-open our hearts,  
to revisit that place,  
outside of time,  
where Spirit lives.

love will still be there.  
It is ALWAYS there,  
as we come and go.
