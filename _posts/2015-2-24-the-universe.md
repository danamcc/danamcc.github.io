Most likely,
the universe doesn’t care,
as galaxies and atoms
wheel about each other,
without regard for my opinion.

Am I any less for that?

As I look out
through this body’s eyes,
I am dreaming meaning,
my own little movie
on the screen of life.

The “truth” I see
is my own creation.

In my own universe,
I am a little God,
like a drop of water
in the ocean of Being.
