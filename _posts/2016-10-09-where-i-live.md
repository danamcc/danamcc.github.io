title: Where I Live

As I strive to stay connected with this web I live in,  
caught up in the give and take of information,  
the creature I think of as “my cat”  
jumps up on my laptop,  
claiming it as his temporary home,  
content to be the center of my attention.  
  
Cut off from reports of recent happenings,  
unable to communicate my views,  
I am nailed to this moment,  
contemplating this being   
who shares my home,  
and reminds me,   
time and again,  
to live in the present.
