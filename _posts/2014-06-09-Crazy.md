There is an infinity of Crazy,  
But only a thin line of Normal.

When those who nurture us,  
Father of our mind,  
Mother of our heart,  
Seem crazy,  
Each in their own way,  
How do (or should) we follow them?

The line of Normal is too thin,  
But Crazy points to everywhere,  
And somewhere,  
Beyond fear,  
Amidst this chaos,  
Lies our freedom.
