Masks

The masks we wear
don't grow with us,
but shrink and crack,
with time and change,
unless they are fed
and cared for.

Without the ego's nurturing,
they  fall away,
in time,
until
we stand naked
before everyone,
emerging,
as from a chrysalis,
into light.

It is a death,
of sorts,
and an awakening.
