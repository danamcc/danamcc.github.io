When you cast your vitriol 
out into the world, 
please be mindful 
of where it may go. 

Words have power - 
the power to sting, 
the power to heal, 
the power to create change. 

When flung about carelessly, 
they often miss their mark, 
wounding innocent ears, 
only spreading more rancor 
within a sea of discord. 

How sad, to pollute this public space 
with more ugliness, 
when, with a bit more care,
we could be planting seeds 
of greater understanding,
healing the wounds
of our human family.
