Everything
is in the eye 
of the beholder.

Yes, there is a world out there,
but we will never see it whole.

Behind our eyes,
we have only glimpses, 
fragments,
a pale reflection
of what is.

But we may also look
at ourselves looking,
see our own seeing,
until how we look
at our own looking
becomes as sharp and clear
as what we think we see
in the world outside.

In each moment of looking,
we may see where
we are looking from,
and choose to shift it,
and view the world anew.
