Everything that can be seen
is in the eye of the beholder.

We will never see the world whole.

behind our eyes
are only glimpses, 
only fragments,
a pale reflection
of what is.

But we may also see
ourselves looking,
see our own seeing,
until how we look
becomes as sharp and clear
as what we think we see.
