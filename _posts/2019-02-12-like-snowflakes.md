We are like snowflakes,
all made of snow,
all the same stuff,
expressing itself 
in a myriad of ways.

We are permutations
of one great pattern,
simple and sacred,
repeating and mutating,
in endless variation. 

We are one great spirit,
refracted through a million lenses.

We are each unique,
and each the same.
