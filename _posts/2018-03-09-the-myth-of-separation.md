title: The Myth of Separation

When I feel the world's beauty,
am I feeling the world outside, 
or just its refection,
in my own world, 
inside?

What if there is no inside or outside,
but just a vast, exquisite whole,
which stands revealed 
when the veil between the worlds falls away,
and the myth of separation subsides?
