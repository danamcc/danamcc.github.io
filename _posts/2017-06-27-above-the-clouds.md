To rise above our own opinions,
like a plane ascending above the clouds,
is to break through into a clear sky,
where there is nothing
but clarity and peace.

Looking down,
we see the cloudy confines
of our usual abode,
a comfortable prison
of prejudice and judgement.

We see the hell below us;
above us, 
there is only only sky.
