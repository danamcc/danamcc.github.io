To rise above our own opinions,
like a plane ascending 
above the clouds,
is to break through 
into a clear sky,
where there is nothing
but clarity and peace.

Looking down,
we see the cloudy confines
where we usually dwell,
our comfortable prison
of prejudice and judgement.

We see the hell below us;
and above us, 
only sky.
