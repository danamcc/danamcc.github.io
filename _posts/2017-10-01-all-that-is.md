_(reflections on my car and the universe)_

I pat my car fondly
as I walk away,
thanking it
for carrying me,
wondering:
does it have a spirit?

And I remember -
it is made
of the same stuff
that I am,
that all things
are made of.

What else is all this,
except spirit,
flowing
in an infinity
of forms?

Everything we know
is built from the dust
of a distant singularity,
still bound,
through some spooky entanglement, 
to its original spirit,
the seed of all that is.

We are all its progeny,
man and beast,
animate and inanimate,
and all of it
is worthy of our love
and our gratitude.
