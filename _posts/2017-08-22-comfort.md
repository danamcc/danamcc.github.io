Every time I feel this urge
to grasp at something,
as I look at what
my empty hands
are trying to hold,
all I see
is emptiness.

Every sense
of "not enough,
not okay,
it must be fixed,
it can't remain like this",
is just a thought,
a distraction
from what is.

To let that thought go,
to relax into the moment,
is to embrace
what is uncomfortable within us,
and give it comfort.
