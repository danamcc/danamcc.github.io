title: As in a Mirror
category: love

From time to time,  
something in me  
still searches for your nature,  
some essence  
that I missed in myself.

I did not realize  
that I was not seeing you,  
but seeing me,  
as in a mirror,  
parts I have not owned,  
projected on your image.

Sometimes,  
I glimpse who you are,  
behind the mask of my illusion,  
and see the light that is your own.

Yes, I saw it  
because it is mine too,  
the shared light of two humans,  
vulnerable and learning.
