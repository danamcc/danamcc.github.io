Sometimes    
Grace creeps up upon us,  
beyond circumstance,  
invisible,  
like the air around us,  
pervasive and sustaining.  
  
It is something  
beyond understanding,  
best met    
only with gratitude,  
surrendering the urge  
to find its source.  
  
This is the moment  
when the membrane   
of separation  
dissolves,  
and we are re-united  
with the Divine  
that contains us,  
our home,  
rediscovered.
