Sometimes,  
Grace creeps up on us,  
beyond circumstance,  
invisible,  
like the air around us,  
pervasive and sustaining.  
  
It is a thing  
beyond understanding,  
to be met only   
with gratitude,  
surrendering the urge  
to find its source.  
  
This is the moment  
when the membrane   
that separates us  
dissolves,  
and we are re-united  
with the Divine  
that contains us,  
our home,  
rediscovered.
