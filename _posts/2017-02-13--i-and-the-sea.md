After this body dies,
will “I” continue on?

This consciousness
which sees through my eyes
may be like a drop of water,
separated for a while
from its mother,
the sea.

When it returns,
dissolving back
into its original home,
will it retain 
the thoughts and stories
that are “me”?

Or will it all melt back,
yielding its identity
to the universal “I”?

If I am but a drop
in this ocean,
may I do what I can,
while I remain in this body,
to purify this bit of water 
that is me,
this little particle 
of Everything,
which is 
my lasting gift.
