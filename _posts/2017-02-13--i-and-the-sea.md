After this body dies,
will “I” continue on?

Perhaps this consciousness
which sees through my eyes
is like a drop of water,
separated for a while
from its mother,
the sea.

When it returns,
dissolving back
into its original home,
will it retain 
the thoughts and stories
that are “me”?

Or will it all melt away,
yielding its identity
to the universal?

This is my prayer:
if I am but a drop
in this ocean,
may I do what I can,
while I remain in this body,
to purify this bit of water 
that is me,
this little piece of Everything,
which is my lasting gift.
