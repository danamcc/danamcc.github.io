Do you like to be yourself
because that's who you are?

Do you like to be yourself
because that's just who you are?

You're not better 
than anyone else,
you're  just who you are.

You're not so different 
from anyone else,
you're  just exactly
who you are.

Do you like to be yourself
because that's who you are?

There is no one
just like you,
and that's just who you are.
