Often, I awaken
in the middle of the night,
convinced there is something 
I must do,
some complicated pathway
back to sleep.

I awaken from a dream,
a half-formed plan
receding from memory,
some urgency
that my dream self
would not abandon.

All these diversions
lure me away 
from peace and rest,
towards goals 
not understood,
not wanted, 
or needed.

And often,
in the light of day,
I am likewise assailed 
by waking dreams,
a myriad of imagined pursuits,
a million distractions 
from the simple pleasures 
of being.

Awakening 
from this daylight dream,
I taste the fulness 
of the moment,
a perfection
that takes no effort 
to attain.
