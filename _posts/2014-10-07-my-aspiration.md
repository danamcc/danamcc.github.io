As a little boy,
I aspired to be a cat.

Now,
near the other end of my life,
I can see again
what my young eyes saw.

A cat simply IS,
supremely content,
in every moment,
with its lack of choice or ability
to become anything other
than what it is.

But we humans,
we are always striving,
to become better,
to be more than we are.

My years have taught me this:
wanting to be different from what we are
is the root of suffering.

Oh, to become like the cat,
accepting our Creatorâ€™s blessing,
bathing in the gratitude
of simply being what we are.
