title: Possibility, Pt.2
category: love
---

it's nice to love you,  
expecting nothing.  
naivete leaves me,  
dreams disperse, dew-like.

it’s just me, here in my life,  
seeing you, over there in yours.  
our paths veer like mountain roads,  
diverging, colliding, sometimes  
gently touching for a moment or two.

this will not fit in any box I know.  
these moments pop into being and pass.  
there is a flow, underneath,  
that cannot be followed.  
it is our path,  
not for us to understand,  
but just to be open to its grace.

these blessings beyond reason –  
I accept them!
