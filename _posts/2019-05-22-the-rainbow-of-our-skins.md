There is no such thing
as a black person,
or a white person,
or a red or yellow person.
 
There is no human skin
which is truly black, 
white, red, or yellow.

Why, then,
do we treat these labels
as if they were real,
delineating some real difference?

The rainbow of our skins
is simply shades
of beige and brown,
with hints of red and yellow.

There is no such thing
as a black person,
or a  white person,
or a red or yellow person.

There are only people.
