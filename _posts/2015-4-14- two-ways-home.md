We came from Spirit,  
and we will return to Spirit.

And even,  
in our brief lives,    
when our minds may drift    
into forgetfulness,    
we are Spirit still.

Until, in a moment of seeing,  
the light of remembrance  
pierces through our darkness,  
And we are already,   
always  
Home.

Our best teachers  
Are those who remind us  
of what is best in ourselves,  
and point the way  
to our path back home.
