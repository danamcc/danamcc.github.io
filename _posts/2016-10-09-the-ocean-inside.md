ï»¿Poised with grace,
gliding effortlessly
along its surface,
you flow with the wave,
without being of it.

Perfectly balanced,
its power propels you,
its energy is yours,
as long as you ride it.

But, to fight it
is to fall
from its grace,
into the turbulence
beneath it.

In the roiling mess
inside it,
you will tumble wildly,
buffeted,
and broken.

To trust in its power,
abandoning resistance,
is to be free
of its violence.
