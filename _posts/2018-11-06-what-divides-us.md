title: What Divides Us

In love, we are united;
in anger and fear, we are divided.

Anger
is the inability or unwillingness
to accept what is.

Fear
is the inability or unwillingness
to accept what might be.

They are the seeds of chaos,
sown by those who would prefer to see us helpless,
unable to meet the ups and downs of life effectively.

Anger and fear are the toxins that sap our power,
leaving us paralyzed by negativity,
unable to relieve our own suffering,
or the suffering of others.
