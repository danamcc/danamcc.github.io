A cat has a brain
The size of a walnut,
And is blessed
With all it needs.

It knows each moment
As complete,
Without knowing how,
Or why.

Yet it is our blessing,
With our Big Brains,
To always wonder how,
And why.

And then,
Full of questions,
We may relinquish answers,
And relax,
Like a cat,
Into Now.
