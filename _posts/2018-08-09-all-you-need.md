_with gratitude for the 50th anniversary theatrical re-release of Yellow Submarine_

Fifty years ago,
I sat gobsmacked,
bathed in your exuberant spirit,
this flood of fantasmagoria
streaming off the screen,
your musicâ€™s mysterious power 
suffusing me.

My young mind
was mesmerized,
awash in this beautiful fable
of love and music
conquering all.

It was a naive dream,
a perfect salve
for the flower children
of a privileged generation,
not yet exposed
to the relentless reality
of human suffering.

Fifty years later,
I am again gobsmacked,
bowled over by the richness
of this sense memory,
revived in all its glory,
and the truth,
rekindled by its brilliance,
that it still conveys:

In a world of suffering 
and violence,
all you ever really need
is love.
