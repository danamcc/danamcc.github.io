This wall you built  
does not protect.

It merely separates  
what was connected.

What safety is there  
in your dream  
of separation?

In my own dream,  
I reach for you,  
and feel you reach for me.

Both dreams are real;  
which dream is true?

Afloat in my thoughts,   
I let go, accepting.

I give in to both dreams,   
trusting.
