title: Those Who Suffer Most

There are those
who have the insight and compassion
to see what is needed in this world,
and the resources to provide it,
whether it be schools,
or hospitals, or other means
to feed the myriad needs
of those who suffer most.

And there are those of us
who share that insight and compassion, 
but lack the means
to fill those physical needs.

For us, then, it is our calling
to offer what encouragement we can
to those who are despairing,
to offer hope for those who are beyond hope,
to point a way forward
for those who have given up on themselves,
who no longer see a path 
out of their own misery.

For us, who are at least blessed
with a modicum of comfort and security,
we may offer, to those who suffer most, 
the promise of what our own experience tells us:
that any human being,
with the recognition of their own worth,
may claim the dignity that is rightfully theirs,
and find the will 
to fight for their own cause,
trusting in the power
of their own humanity.
