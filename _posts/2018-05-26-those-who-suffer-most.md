title: Those Who Suffer Most

There are those
who have the insight and compassion
to see what is needed in this world,
and the resources to provide it,
be it schools, or hospitals, or other means
to feed the myriad needs
of those who suffer most.

And there are those of us
who share that insight and compassion, 
but lack the means
to fill those physical needs.

It is our calling,then,
to offer the despairing
what encouragement we can,
to offer hope 
for those beyond hope,
to show a path
for those who have given up,
who no longer see a way 
out of their own misery.

For us who are blessed
with a modicum of comfort and security,
we may offer the promise,
to those who suffer most,
of what our own experience tells us:
that any human being,
empowered with the recognition 
of their own worth,
may claim the dignity 
that is rightfully theirs,
and find the will 
to fight their own cause,
trusting in the power
of their own humanity.
