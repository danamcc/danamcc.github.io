Before history,  
our ancestors stood in fear,  
scanning,   
in their minds’ eye,  
for unseen danger.  
  
Time and again,  
their big brains saved them,  
skirting perils unimagined  
by simpler minds.  
  
And now,  
we walk   
through a safer world,  
wrapped in a cocoon  
of civilization.  
  
But still,  
the fear remains,  
that something unseen  
and dangerous  
always lurks nearby.  
  
In the slow dance of evolution,  
our big brains  
still scan that unseen jungle,  
always alert,  
a heartbeat away  
from fight or flight.  
  
And what else,   
in this world we are building,  
might our big brains see,  
beyond that jungle?  
  
In the mind’s eye,  
our world is infinite,  
if we choose to look,  
and always,  
just a blink away,   
is the Garden  
we were born from.
