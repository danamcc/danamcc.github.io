title: A Leaf Has No Story
category: life

A leaf
floating
down a stream
has no story.

We may follow it,
as it spills into a river,
and then into the sea;
or trace it backwards
to the branch it grew on,
the bud it sprang from.

Thus,
we add
the thread of history
that our minds weave,
as we do with our own lives.

To the leaf,
there is only this instant
of vibrant aliveness,
flowing onward.

What a gift
it would be,
to see ourselves
thisÂ  simply.
