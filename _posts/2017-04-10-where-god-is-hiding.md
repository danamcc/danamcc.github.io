The story of Jesus,
profound and beautiful,
has been an inspiration 
to countless souls
across the millennia.

If, perhaps,
it is not the literal truth,
certainly it can teach us
our true potential,
the promise of finding the god
within us all.

And surely 
all the stories
of all of our prophets,
in all of our history,
all of our cultures,
have pointed to this same place,
where God is hiding,
waiting to be found,
ready to be found
in everything.
