It is not the news 
of what actually happens 
which weighs us down. 

It is the endless commentary, 
reactions and opinions, 
ad infinitum, 
which overwhelm us, 
feeding our fear,
our anger and despair. 

In the light of reason, 
we can manage in this world.

In the lens of media, 
we are near to burning up 
in its intensity.
