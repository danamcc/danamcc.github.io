A human body,
as it passes a certain age,
Is like a good used car.

Though time
has had its way with it,
It retains its essence,
maintaining its functions
despite the myriad indignities 
of entropy.

It allows each of us 
to do what we need to do,
and go where we need to go,
remaining a trusted vessel 
for expressing our own essence,
for continuing to be our true selves,
despite the little ravages of time.
