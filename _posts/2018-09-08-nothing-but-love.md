Love of the particular
is like a lever
which pries open the heart
at least a crack,
and letâ€™s the light 
of the universal
shine through.

Each beautiful sight,
each beautiful person,
is like a glimpse 
of a greater beauty
we do not always see.

And when we love 
without attachment,
the lever becomes a key,
which opens the door 
to everything that can be loved,
to a universe
that is nothing but love.
