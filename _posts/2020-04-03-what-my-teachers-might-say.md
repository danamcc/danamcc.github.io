title: What My Teachers Might Say

I heard a sad story 
on the radio today.

An elderly couple 
was held on a cruise ship 
for three days,
then kept in quarantine 
for fourteen days. 

It was a time of suffering, 
full of stress and fear. 

As I listened, 
I felt anger welling up, 
until I stopped to think, 
“What would my spiritual teachers 
have to say about this?”

Perhaps they would say:
“Look beneath your anger,
and most likely, 
you will find sadness, 
or helplessness, 
or hopelessness. 

Then, you may look under that, 
and you may find compassion, 
enough for yourself, 
and for everyone”.￼￼￼￼
