Each thought, as it passes by
in our stream of thinking,
is like the seed of a little world,
the embryo of a pocket universe
that we could choose to live in,
if we nurtured it with our attention.

What heavens or hells do we conjure 
when our thoughts run wild,
which could germinate
in the light of our regard?

How often do we remember
that we CAN choose,
that we are always one step away
from joy or suffering?
