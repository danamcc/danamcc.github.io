There is too much bullshit in our world.

Let us only say what we mean,  
and mean what we say.

Words have power  
to harm and to heal.

They can be weapons  
that intimidate and manipulate,  
or tools of wisdom  
that nurture and heal.

They spread like cancer,  
or like light.

Let us learn to speak responsibly,  
with compassion and integrity,  
or simply hold our silence.
