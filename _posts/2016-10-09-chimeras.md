The seed of any emotion  
is simply energy.  
  
It takes root  
in the soil   
of memory,  
and grows   
with the water  
of attention.  
  
If it is not nurtured  
with continued attention,  
it will simply wither,   
and pass away,  
like a cloud,  
like all things   
in nature.  
  
To observe all this  
in the moment of arising,  
is to see these clouds  
for what they are,  
chimeras  
in a clear   
and limitless   
sky.
