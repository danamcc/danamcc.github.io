Love can be 
like cool, clear water,
when it isn't muddied
by need.

Relax your hold
on what you want to keep,
and revel in the flow,
as objects of love
come and go, 
and what remains
is love.

All the love
we find outside ourselves
is only a mirror
of the love we are.

When we look back,
and see our own reflection,
then there is an end
to our search for completeness.
