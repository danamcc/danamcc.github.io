title: Me and My Ego

I spend a lot of time wondering
if I have freed myself 
from my ego,
and that is just my ego,
worrying about itself. 

It worries a lot,
about my shortcomings,
if I'm "doing it right",
as it tries to remodel itself
into something new and improved,
but always reluctant
to release its grip
on how I see the world.

It is a snake of thought 
eating its own tail,
a loop from nowhere to nowhere,
maintaining its power for only as long 
as I feed it with my attention and concern.
