title: Me and My Ego

I spend a lot of time wondering
if I have freed myself from my ego,
and that is just my ego,
worrying about itself. 

It worries a lot,
about my shortcomings,
and if I'm "doing it right",
trying to remodel itself
into a new, improved version,
but always reluctant
to release its grip
on how I see the world.

It is a snake of thought 
eating its own tail,
a loop to nowhere,
drawing its life
from my attention 
and concern.
