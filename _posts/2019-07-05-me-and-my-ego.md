title: Me and My Ego

I think too much
about transcending my ego,
and that is my ego,
worrying about itself. 

It worries about my shortcomings,
wondering 
if I'm "doing it right",
trying to remodel itself
into a new, improved version,
without releasing its grip
on how I see the world.

It is a loop to nowhere,
a snake of thought 
eating its own tail,
as long as I feed it
with my attention 
and concern.
