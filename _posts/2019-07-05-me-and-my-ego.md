title: Me and My Ego

I often wonder
if I have freed myself 
from my own ego,
but that is just my ego,
worrying about itself. 

It worries a lot,
about my shortcomings,
and if I'm "doing it right",
as it tries to remodel itself
into something new and improved,
yet always reluctant
to release its grip
on how I see the world.

It is a snake of thought 
eating its own tail,
in a loop to nowhere,
maintaining its power 
for as long as I feed it 
with my attention and concern.
