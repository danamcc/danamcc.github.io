On this roller coaster,  
there are no tracks,  
except the ones  
our minds lay down.

Not trusting there solidity,  
we buoy them up with thought,  
but sometimes, still,  
they crumble into nothing,  
and we are flying free.

There is nothing below us,  
and there never was.  
In this vertigo of falling,  
we can abandon hope and fear  
(as in an amusement park),  
for the thrill, instead,  
of this ride of a lifetime.
