title: Giving Up the Struggle

There are voices that tell me
“This is not the way it should be”,
and “I am not the way I should be”,
or “you are not the way you should be.”

When I believe them,
everything is a struggle.

But when I stop to hear
that they are only so much noise,
devoid of meaning
unless I give them meaning,
then everything is easy;
and everything is okay.

At any particular moment,
there is  most likely nothing
that really needs to be done.

What a relief,
to relax in that moment,
letting go 
of the need to change it,
enjoying the peace
of giving up the struggle.
