title: An Unexamined Thought

An unexamined thought  
  is like a knife in a drawer,  
    an unseen weapon  
       that can grow  
       into poison.

It can slip  
  into the soup  
    of our consciousness  
unnoticed,  
  unless,  
    in mindfulness,  
we recognize  
  its bitter taste.

In the light of our awareness,  
  the mind is our greatest gift,  
    but, when we sleepwalk  
       through our own darkness,  
       it can be our undoing.
