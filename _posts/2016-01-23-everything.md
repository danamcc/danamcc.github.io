﻿This little me  
that I think I am  
can not deserve  
or hold  
the freedom  
of being everything.
But   
what if  
that is just a fitful dream,  
and there is nothing here  
except everything?
Perhaps the gift   
of waking up  
is becoming Nobody,  
and inheriting everything  
that we thought we weren’t.
