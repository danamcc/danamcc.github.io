To find someone   
who meets your expectations  
may be the worst thing   
that could happen,  
a time bomb   
dressed as a gift,  
a fluke of chance   
which becomes,   
in your imagination,  
an entitlement,  
and then a prison.  
  
To live the illusion  
that what you prefer  
should be your birthright  
is to be unprepared,  
and ultimately blindsided,  
by the inevitability  
of change,  
and disappointment.  
  
Better, then,  
to embrace the imperfect,  
and cherish the impermanent,  
to feel blessed   
by whatever comes,  
desired or not.  
  
To love someoneâ€™s flaws  
and their virtues,  
equally,  
is to love them fully.  
  
But to love only   
what is desired,  
is to love   
an empty dream.
