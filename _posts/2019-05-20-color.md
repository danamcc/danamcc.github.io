There is no human skin
which is truly white,
or truly black.

Why, then,
do we live by these labels,
as if they were real,
delineating something significant?

The rainbow of human flesh
is simply shades
of beige and brown,
with hints of red and yellow.

There is no such thing
as a white person,
or a black person,
or a red or yellow person.

There are only people.
