Life is a work in progress.

A poem or a song completes itself -
it has an end.

A painting, a sculpture
stands in its final form
for everyone to see.

A life is a little piece of a continuum;
when it ends, we will not be there to see it.

It is a phrase in the worldâ€™s song,
sung always,
phrase by phrase,
until the world itself is gone.
