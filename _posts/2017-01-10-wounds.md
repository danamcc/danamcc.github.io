Some wounds become covered 
with bandaids of distraction,
which shield,
but do not heal.

Until,
when inspiration and courage strike,
the bandage is ripped away,
exposing what is raw and tender
underneath.

The air stings,
and the light burns,
As the pain, exposed,
flows out,
and away.

It is that moment of violence
against our own defenses
which frees us,
so that time
can heal us.
