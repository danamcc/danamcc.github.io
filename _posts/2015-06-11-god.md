God   
is the emergent intelligence  
of the universe,  
expressed everywhere,  
and always.  
  
It is the spirit  
that permeates   
everything,  
but is,   
mostly,  
beyond our understanding.  
  
It is our gift, however,  
to experience it,  
from time to time,  
in glimpses  
that transcend our minds.
