How to do something:

empty your mind,
and see what needs 
to be done;

then empty your mind,
and do it;

and then empty your mind,
and keep doing it,
until you see 
that it is done.

___

Cooking
is like writing,
or painting,
like making music,
or making love.

When "what should I do?"
falls away,
that is when
there is no one there,
and that is when 
the  magic happens.
