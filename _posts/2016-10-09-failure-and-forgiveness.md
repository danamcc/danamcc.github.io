*Every failed relationship
leaves an imprint on us,
both a lesson of what went wrong,
and the touch of another soul
that has made us richer,
and a little wiser:*


A PRAYER OF FORGIVENESS

Perhaps
we were never
really friends,
though I thought we were.

And I forgive you.

Perhaps
I only imagined
we loved each other.

And I forgive myself.

There was a pull
of attachment,
a need for comfort,
for validation,
that we could not resist.

And I forgive us both.

We shared
what love and friendship
we knew how to give,
despite the pain we caused.

And I forgive us.
