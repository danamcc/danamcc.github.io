title: The Craziest Part of Me

When I was a younger man,
the craziest part of me
felt like the closest I could come
to being sacred.

Then, with age encroaching,
I strived to be more reasonable,
to quell my wilder impulses,
to protect myself
from the dissolution  
of unfettered freedom.

And now,  
as I see an end to this journey,
not as distant as it once was,
I can see the wisdom
that my younger self
could take on faith:
that we are all God's wildest creatures,
blessed and cursed to find our way
beyond our own boundaries,
past what we think
is sane, or safe,
or reasonable.
