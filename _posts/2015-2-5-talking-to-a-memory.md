title: Talking to a Memory
category: love
---
In this moment,   
I look to see whoâ€™s there,  
and see no one.

Is the mirror of my memory,  
just an error of my memory?

Who did I ever see,  
across from me,  
but a reflection  
of my own heart?

Who do we ever see,  
except other hearts  
that seem to beat,  
in that moment,   
in time with ours?
