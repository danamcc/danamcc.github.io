In this moment,   
I look to see whoâ€™s there,  
and I see no one.

Is the mirror of my memory,  
only an error in my memory?

Who did I ever see,  
across from me,  
but a reflection  
of my own heart?

Who do we ever see,  
except other hearts  
that seem to beat,  
in that moment,   
in time with ours?

Which is the illusion:  
that we are separate,  
or that we are One?
