_I think that sometimes, we long to be what we think we aren't, but really already are. Maybe it's as simple as letting go of wanting. This isn't the only path to happiness, but  surely it's a good start_

To die as an ego
And be reborn as Being,
That is the dream.

Ego dreams the dream.
But Being IS the dream.
The dream already real.

Being is inside the dream;
And the dream is inside Being.
