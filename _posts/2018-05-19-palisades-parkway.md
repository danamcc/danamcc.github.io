Streaming down the Palisades Parkway,
trees roll by in stately procession,
distant hills framed in their embrace,
as the road snakes ahead of me.

Sliding down this highway
like blood through a vein,
I glide along this borderland,
the edge between two worlds.

How beautiful, this dance 
between the works of Nature
and the artifices of Man!

What serendipity,
to be cradled thus,
in my little machine,
amongst this verdant bounty!
