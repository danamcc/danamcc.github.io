As I motor down the Palisades Parkway,
trees roll in stately procession,
towards and past me,
distant hills framed in their embrace,
as the road snakes before me.

Propelled down this highway
like blood shooting through a vein,
I glide through this wonderland
on the edge between two worlds.

How beautiful, this dance 
between the works of Nature
and the artifices of Man!
