 I wish I was there to hold you, curled up in my lap like a baby,  
To pet your head, your hair, your face, your eyes.  
As you rest in my arms, I would feel your breath slowing, your tension easing,  
your mind slipping into peacefulness. 

If our universe were different, I would slip through the interstices of matter,  
To find you on the other side, and share what comfort I could with my touch.  
If space and time weren't in between, I would be with you now. 

 But in my heart's mind, when I think of you, space and time melt,  
And these things ARE possible, and they do happen, now.  
I see and feel you next to me, your breath and softness filling me.

 Your tenderness, your gentle spirit,  
Awakening my softest self,   Vulnerable, alive.
