title: Cruelty and kindness
category: life

Our universe  
is not cruel,  
and neither  
is it kind.  
  
It simply IS,  
a container  
for everything,  
matter and mind,  
energy and spirit.  
  
It is WE,  
who think and feel,  
who create cruelty   
and kindness,  
needless suffering,  
and compassion.  
  
It is always our choice,  
our burden,  
our gift,  
seen   
or unseen,  
to do so.
