When we talk to ourselves,
who talks to who,
and who is it
that hears the conversation?

Who is it
that can observe
all this going on,
and wonder:
who are  all these I's?

Perhaps they are all
just smoke  and mirrors,
eddies in the flow  of consciousness,
the river of "I am".

Evanescent,
like rain drops,
forming and dissolving,
each one catches the light
for a moment,
and then disappears.
