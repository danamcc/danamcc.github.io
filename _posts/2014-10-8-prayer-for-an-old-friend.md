There is a gift you gave,
perhaps unknowing.

In the mirror of your nurturing spirit,
I glimpsed the nurturing spirit within,
which I have always had,
but somehow forgot.

Thank you for sharing what you could,
and pointing me back to my Self,
where all I need
awaits me.

May the light you shined on my life
shine back on you, and
may the blessings you shared with me
bless you, always.
