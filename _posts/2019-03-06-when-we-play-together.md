When we play together
it is not about playing faster or louder
than anyone else,
it is about playing
in rapport with each other.

The simplest beat
may be the most powerful,
when we play together.

The slowest beat
can be the most exciting,
when we play together.

In sync together,
we are in a harmony
that goes beyond music,
that reaches into spirit,
when we play together.
