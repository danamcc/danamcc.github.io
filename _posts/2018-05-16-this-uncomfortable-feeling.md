This uncomfortable feeling
wouldn't seem so bad,
if not for the thought
that I shouldn't be having it.

When I let go of that thought,
and simply sit with the feeling,
it softens,
and soon fades.

It was just a tinge of energy,
with some ideas floating around it,
and it all dissipates,
like smoke,
when I simply let it be.
