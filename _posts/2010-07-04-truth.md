Sometimes the truth is like a weapon,  
Sometimes, a way to see;  
Sometimes we use it to be right,  
Sometimes it sets us free.

And, there are times when it multiplies,  
Like the branches of a tree,  
Splitting and growing into different worlds,  
One for you; one for me.

And somewhere, there’s a bigger truth,  
Without a capital “T”,  
With room enough for each of us  
To grow, to love, to be.
