title: Love and Seeing
category: life

Each pair of eyes
sees a world
unique
to the beholder.

To love another being
is to borrow their eyes,
to see the universe
they live in,
at the same time
as our own.

Each one is a sliver
of the greater Whole,
beyond what any one
can see.

The more we love,
the more these glimpses
stretch our boundaries,
encompassing
more and more
of What Is.
