In our world of ideas,
there is Buddhism,
and Hinduism,
Taoism,
Judaism,
Catholicism.

In the world of being,
there are no "isms".

There is only One,
simple
and inseparable.

Only in our minds
does it fragment,
breaking into complexity,
an infinity of paths,
all to the same truth.

This is where ALL our teachers
have pointed.

This is where we started from
and, with Grace,
where we may return.
