My life is full
of unnecessary things,
mountains of mementos
of past incarnations
and impersonations,
a plethora of previous iterations
of who I thought I was.

And here I am,
seeing my own history from outside of it,
amazed and aghast at how much stuff
my former selves have accumulated,
all in the name of hanging on
to who I thought I was.
