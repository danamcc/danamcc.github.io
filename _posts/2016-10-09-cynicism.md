﻿Cynicism
is just the mind’s defense,

a mechanism
to protect ourselves
from each other;

imagining differences
between us,

afraid to acknowledge
how we are the same.

It is the voice that says:
“I will not let THAT asshole know
that I am, perhaps,
an asshole, too!”.

But, in moments of grace,
there is another voice,
stripped of conceit,
that says:
“Yes, you are human,
as I am, too”.
