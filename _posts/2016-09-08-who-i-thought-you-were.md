Perhaps
I will never unravel
the mystery
of who I thought
you were.

Was knowing you a mirror
for my completeness,
or a salve for the wound
of what I thought was lacking
in myself?

Maybe it was it both,
flickering like light
strobing
through a picket fence.

In a blur of seeing and confusion,
I saw a possibility,
and a dream,
like a drug,
or an awakening.

It was all of that,
two egos  chafing,
hearts colliding
in moments of recognition,
and moments of fear.

What remains
is the taste
of someone known,
if just in passing,
a snapshot,
on the way to discovering
ourselves.
