What is the thread of friendship?
Is it seeing and knowing another as they are,
or as you expect them to be?

Is it a letting go, a letting in,
or a contract of mutually agreed behavior?

Is it a flow, a dance,
like water, like wind,
or the choreography of a well-oiled machine,
proceeding safely through its prescribed path?

A machine can wear down,
be broken.
Water and wind dance on,
always.
