title: A Note To My Self
category: Being Human 
---

All my life,  
I've been avoiding a great truth,  
and pursuing a fantasy.

That truth is that I am  
(like every human being)  
completely and irrevocably alone.

The fantasy was that I could find someone  
to complete the incomplete "me"  
that I thought I was.

Now, I am learning that that "me" is itself a fantasy,  
and that the "I am that I am"  
always was and already is complete.

I feel free of a great burden.  
There is nothing and no one I need to add to my life to be fulfilled.  
Everything that comes my way is gift.
