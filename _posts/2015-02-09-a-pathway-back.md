title: A Pathway Back

In every one of us,
there is a universe of pain
we are bound to run away from,
addicted to avoidance,
slipping into waking sleep.

Soothed by unconsciousness,
we lose the vibrant sting of feeling,
bit by bit, day by day,
running further and further
from ourselves.

And each stab of pain
is an invitation,
a pathway back,
to stand poised,
as sleep beckons,
and observe the pain
and the urge to flee.

At the fulcrum of choice,
this moment of seeing,
lies our power.

This is being alive!
