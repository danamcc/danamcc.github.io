To delight in fantasy  
is to give shape  
to our imagination,  
manifested in the world.  
  
To savor reality  
is to let the richness of the world  
take shape in our minds,  
infusing us.  
  
To confuse the two  
is to wander lost,  
blind to the gifts  
of each realm,  
forever groping  
for a world that isnâ€™t.
