The people in our lives
are like the air around us,
like molecules dancing 
in Brownian motion.

We are all caught up 
in a quantum quadrille,
temporary partners
in a grand squaredance,
brought together
and torn asunder,
jostled and pulled 
by chaos and karma.

We are dancing a dance
of serendipity and tragedy,
understanding and conflict,
friends and enemies,
coming and going
in endless patterns.

It is the soup
of our experience,
flavored 
with the richness of joy,
and the bitterness
of defeat.

It is this dance
that makes us alive,
with all its vicissitudes,
and all its grace.
