Everything we see and touch
is just a temporary arrangement of molecules,
which are temporary arrangements of atoms,
made up of a temporary arrangement of particles
which no one really understands.

It is all just a dance of dancers
dancing the dance of smaller dancers;
turtles, all the way down.

And we are the leaves 
of seeing and feeling
ever floating on this sea of change,
marveling at each snapshot
in this endless panorama.
