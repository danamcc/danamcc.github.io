_It’s a shame that the alt-right has appropriate the phrase “All lives matter”, because of course, every living being deserves a shot at happiness and an end to suffering._

I matter too,
just because I am here,
just because I am human,
just because I hurt, 
just because I feel.

I am not alone;
I am not lost.


I don’t need to be silent.

I don’t need to be anything
that I am not.
