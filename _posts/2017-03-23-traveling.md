What if you stepped into each moment
like a new country,
attuned to its uniqueness,
drinking in its sights and sounds?

Revelling in its differences,
you would sidestep the familiar,
grateful and eager for newness.

What if you traveled through your life 
as you would travel the world, 
always moving,
with excitement,
into a foreign land?
