What if you stepped into each moment
like a new country,
attuned to its uniqueness,
drinking in its sights and sounds?

Revelling in its differences,
you would sidestep the familiar,
grateful and eager for newness.

What if we traveled through our lives 
as we would travel the world, 
always moving,
with welcoming excitement,
into a foreign land?
