We are all assholes,
and we are
luminous beings!

In the land of ego, 
we always struggle to be right,
combatting all the Others
who are always wrong.

In the land of Spirit,
there is no right and wrong,
there is no separation.

We are the same,
in our suffering
and our joy,
or we are nothing
but smoke,
dissipating
in the wind of time.
