We are luminous beings,
obscured by clouds.

Too often,
the clouds become our world,
the props in our drama,
fears and hopes made real,
cloaking our light.

We are spirit and energy,
caked with the dust 
of old ideas,
ossified by the rituals
of our stories.

To bore through this artifice
with the drill of attention,
mindfulnessâ€™s patient practice,
is to break free,
bursting into brilliance,
whole once more.
