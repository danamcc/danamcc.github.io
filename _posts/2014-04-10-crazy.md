Crazy is infinite;  
Normal is a thin line.

When those who nurtured us,  
fathers of our minds,  
mothers of our hearts,  
seemed crazy,  
each in their own way,  
how do,  
how should  
we follow them?

The line of Normal  
is too thin;  
Crazy points everywhere.  
Somewhere,  
beyond fear,  
amidst the chaos,  
is freedom.
