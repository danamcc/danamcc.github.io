IN MEMORY

When those you love
slip away,
beyond the realm of things,
it is like rock dissolving,
icons turning into smoke.

Our minds build museums
full of statuesque certainty,
which always crumbles,
returning to dust.

And, in those clouds of dust,
is the essence,
not of memories,
but of love itself.

- D. McCurdy
