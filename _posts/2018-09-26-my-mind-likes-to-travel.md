title: My Mind Likes To Travel

My bank account may not permit 
a trip to foreign places, 
but I can send my mind away 
to new and peaceful spaces. 

My thoughts are like a road I take
to the world I live inside,
and how I guide or follow them
is my birthright to decide.

I could send myself to the gates of Hell,
if I gave my thoughts their play,
or sit in bliss in my own heaven,
if I send my mind that way.

We can travel the earth
in search of relief
from the pain of our daily grind,
or follow the path
to our heart of hearts,
and find our peace of mind.
