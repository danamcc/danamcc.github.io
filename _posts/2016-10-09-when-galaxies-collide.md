When galaxies collide,
is there chaos,
or is there union?

In the short run,
there is chaos;
in the long run,
union.

And so,
when two people
join their lives,
pulled by attraction,
then, as they commingle,
there are a million moments
of conflict and confusion,
slowly dissolving,
with the winding down of entropy,
as their differences dissolve.

As the progeny
of this union,
I am cursed
and blessed,
sorting out
the subtle differences,
befuddled and amazed,
aghast and grateful,
at this evolution
of being.
