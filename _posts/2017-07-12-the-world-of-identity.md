The least important thing
about another human being
is who they are.

In the world of identity,
they are only
who they think they are,
or who you think they are.

And so, in that world,
we are merely snapshots
in each other's minds,
images frozen 
from a moment's perception,
separate from the flow of time,
seen only through the lense
of our own identities.

Without those images,
we become the same,
a giant family,
drifting down 
a common river.

We are born from the same place,
and bound for the same place,
always sharing 
our suffering
and our joy.
