The most important thing
about another human being
isn't who they are.

In the world of identity,
they are only
who they think they are,
or who you think they are.

In that world,
we are merely snapshots
in each other's minds,
images frozen 
from a moment's perception,
separate from the flow of time,
seen only through the lense
of our own identities.

Beyond those images,
we are the same,
one giant family,
drifting down 
a common river.

We are born 
from the same place,
and bound 
for the same place,
always sharing 
our suffering
and our joy.
