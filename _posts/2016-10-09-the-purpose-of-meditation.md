The purpose of meditation  
is not to become better.  
  
It is spending time  
not trying to change,  
accepting what you are,  
what you think,  
what you feel,  
without judgement  
or complaint.  
  
It is becoming   
a compassionate observer,  
befriending yourself,  
and all your little selves,  
enfolding them  
in kind acceptance,  
embracing them,  
with all their little fears,  
in the arms of love.
