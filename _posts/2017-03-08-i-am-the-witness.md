As long as I am a human
walking on this earth,
there are things I have been given,
for as long as I am here.

I have this body,
but I am not this body;
I have this mind,
but I am not this mind.

I am not my thoughts,
or my feelings;
my dreams,
or my fears.

I am what came before them,
and will last beyond them.

I am the flow of life,
and its joyful witness.
