title: Shift Happens

When something inside shifts,
and the light shines through,
the Mind says: “Aha,
THAT is the way!”

Then something else shifts,
and, like a cat,
the Mind chases after it.

Always in pursuit,
locked on to its image of “the way”,
it misses the joy (unlike the cat)
of simply moving.
