title: An End To Seeking

More and more,
I am realizing 
that there is no destination, 
beyond the full experience
of where I already am. 

The less I look outside myself 
or to the future, 
the more I discover 
the completeness 
that is already in me. 

The more the distractions 
of seeking and grasping 
fall away, 
the more I uncover the perfection 
that is already always there!
