Sometimes, words arenâ€™t enough,  
And feeling floods me,  
Like warm water,  
Floating me inward, up, and out.

I slide into a parallel place,  
A breath away from here,  
And there you are,  
Your body sleeping,  
Your spirit free.  
I curl up beside you,  
Feeling your warmth, giving you mine.

This is our gentle dance, our silent blessing,  
Touching softly across a continent,  
A long and tender thread, always between us.  
This is our silent blessing, our gentle dance.
