To bring peace to the world
may seem an impossible task.

Yet, to bring peace to oneself
is doable.

And if,
having found peace,
each one would share it
with two others,
who would each share
with two more,
where would it end?

Just as our cells replicate
in their exponential dance,
so could the peace
of one human soul spread
to encompass everyone.

As 2 becomes 4,
and 4 becomes 8,
there are only
THIRTY THREE steps
between peace for one,
and peace for everyone.
