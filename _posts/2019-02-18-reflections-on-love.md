Romantic love
is the falling away
of the boundaries you perceive
between you and another.

Universal love
is the falling away
of the boundaries you perceive
between you and ALL others.

You may fall in love,
and out of love,
with a particular person.

But when you learn 
how to love everyone,
yourself included,
that will last forever.
