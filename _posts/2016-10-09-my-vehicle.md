I have an old car -
it gets me
where I need to go,
safely,
without incident.

it has dents on the outside,
door handles and windows
that donâ€™t work.

It is full of quirks
and noises.

It gets me
where I need to go,
safely,
without incident,
and I am grateful.

I have a body
which has known
younger years.

It was leaner,
faster,
stronger,
and more nimble.

It loses energy,
sometimes,
and needs more sleep.

It wakes me up,
sometimes,
with minor aches and pains,
and the urge to pee.

It is the vessel
my spirit drives around in.

It gets me
where I need to go,
safely,
without incident,
and I am grateful.
