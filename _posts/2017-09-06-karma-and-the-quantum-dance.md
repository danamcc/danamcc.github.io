What if the stars and planets,
as they spin around the sky,
have no more effect on our lives
than a butterfly's breath,
half a world away?

What if this dance,
in its infinite grace,
embraces the chaos around us,
shaping our experiences,
but not limiting them?

What if each 
of our predicaments 
has no cause
but our fears colliding
with the quantum dance of chance,
in this infinite universe,
amongst an infinity
of universes?

What if karma, itself,
is not a mechanism,
but simply 
the greatest dance
of all?
