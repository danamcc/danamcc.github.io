There is a scared and whimpering child inside me,
and there is a tyrant,
a victim,
and a judge.

They do not know they are one,
two sides of a coin.

There is a realist,
and a dreamer,
a planner,
a fixer.

All one.

All drops in the bucket
which is Me,
little mental movies,
fragments and glimpses,
partly understood,
aspects of a Self too big
for the mind to hold.
