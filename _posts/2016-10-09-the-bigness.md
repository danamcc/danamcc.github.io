title: The bigness
category: life

We mostly live In bubbles
of our own imaginings,
little worlds
of story,
want,
and fear.

When that membrane
that protects and isolates
touches the big world,
something resonates,
or buzzes with alarm.

We shrink,
hardening our skin,
sinking further
into separateness,
or we expand,
softening,
letting in
the bigness,
bit by bit.
