Walking to the door with your mask of indifference,  
What price do you pay for your daily compromise?

You have sold yourself for a dream of security,  
The promise of safety  
in shark-filled seas.

How does each long night pass,  
When darker dreams break through,  
And the face of your broken integrity  
Stares back at you?

Was there a moment when the choice was clear,  
Or did you slip, beguiled and unawares,  
Into the machine that has eaten you?

Are you still in there,  
Longing for freedom,  
Or does the lure of safety still lull you,  
Snug in the dream of protection?
