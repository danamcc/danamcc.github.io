ï»¿There is a universe  
inside us  
where everything  
is reachable.  
But,    
we build our little worlds  
within our minds,  
rooms of thoughts and memories,  
doors and windows closed  
to the vastness beyond.  
How simple  
(in a moment of choice)  
to look beyond them,  
and remember  
that they are merely imagined,  
and that we stand  
in the middle of everything.
