Things don't care
if they are seen,
but we, as humans, 
do.

We long to be cherished,
dreading dismissal
or disgust.

But a thing
simply is,
devoid of doubt,
empty of self-image,
free of concern
for what it is.

How would it be
to learn that freedom,
abandoning our discontent 
with how we are?

Perhaps,
through learning to love 
everything else,
just as it is,
we can learn to love ourselves,
and each other, 
just as we are.
