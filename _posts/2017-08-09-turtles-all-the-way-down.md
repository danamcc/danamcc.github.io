Everything in this universe 
(and perhaps beyond)
is interdependent.

There is no "thing"
that has its own existence,
separate from all others.

And there is nothing
which is not impermanent,
that does not only exist
in a constant state of change.

What we see 
are the forms
that matter, energy, and thought
pass through,
in the flow of time.

Each thing seen
is the sum of smaller parts,
each made of smaller parts still,
all the way down.

Each form we know
was born 
from an earlier form,
itself born 
from one earlier still,
all the way down.

It is as if our Earth
lies on the back 
of a giant turtle,
itself on the back
of another giant turtle, 
and so on, and so on,
all the way down.


Without these turtles,
are we still here?
