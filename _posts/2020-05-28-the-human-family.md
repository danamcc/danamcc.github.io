I am not a Democrat, nor a Liberal;
not a white man, nor an American.

I am sick and tired of being tugged at
by the forces of my culture
that yearn to label me
as a faceless member of their group,
proud in its difference
from every other group. 

In the words of the prophet Groucho: 
“I refuse to join any club 
that would have me as a member”;
I am a human being,
and I am simply myself.

Let me be,
and let everyone be,
so we may become the human family,
united in our idiosyncrasies,
that we were born to be.
