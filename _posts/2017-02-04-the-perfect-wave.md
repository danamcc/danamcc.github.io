_With much gratitude
to Venerable Amy Miller_

Life can feel
like an angry sea,
wave upon wave
throwing us onward,
across its roiling surface.

And what if we could meet each wave
as would a happy surfer,
greeting it as the perfect wave,
offering the ride of a lifetime?

What would we balance on,
on the surfboard of our dreams,
if not the openness of our hearts,
and the fearless intention
of our minds and spirits?
