title: The World We Live In

This much I know
from the internet:
there is evil everywhere,
and everything is dangerous.

Why then,
do I walk outside
and see a world 
full of beauty,
and so many people 
willing to be kind?

Which is more useful:
the nightmare of our worst fears,
amplified through endless retelling,
or the dream of our true nature,
spread through the practice
of loving kindness?

We have a choice,
in what we read,
in what we say, 
in what we do,
to act as if
we live in a world
we would all be happier 
to live in,
until, through our vision
and our persistence,
it becomes reality
for everyone.
