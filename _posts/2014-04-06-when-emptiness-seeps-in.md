title: When Emptiness Seeps In
category: life

When your entertainment ends,
And emptiness seeps in,
Don't look away.

Let it take your full attention.
It is the drama of the moment,
Played against the nothingness
Of everything.

On the screen of being,
Nothing is assured,
And everything is possible.
