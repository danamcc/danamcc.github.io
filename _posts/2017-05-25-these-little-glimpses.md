How can we be complacent,
when we live in a universe like this?

We are surrounded by wonders,
sometimes hidden,
too often ignored.

To open our eyes and hearts
to the grandeur around us
is to let ourselves be overwhelmed,
carried beyond all understanding,
beyond ourselves,
beyond the little limits
of our lives.

We are tiny particles of the limitless,
destined never to grasp it whole,
but blessed to rejoice
in these little glimpses
we are given.
