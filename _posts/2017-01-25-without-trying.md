I am not the person 
I may be expected to be. 

Peeling away the layers 
of who I am not, 
the urge to please 
and appease 
slowly drop away. 

I have tried 
to smooth my edges 
to fit the shapes 
I thought 
my world wanted. 

I did not see 
that my map of it 
was of my own imagining, 
that what truly fits 
into its shifting tapestry
is itself constantly changing,
part of its flow.

There is a place
in this big world
for everything
to be what it is,
to find its own shape,
fluid and dynamic,
without trying
to be otherwise.
