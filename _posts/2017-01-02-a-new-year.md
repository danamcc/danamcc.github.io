Today we began
our next trip
around the sun.

Part of our path
is laid out before us,
the momentum
of planets and particles,
people and plans.

All the rest is a cloud
of Brownian motion,
a million choices,
seen and unseen, 
taken and not taken.

As we weave our way
through the web ahead,
may we see, all the while,
something in the distance
worth finding,
and, step by mindful step,
make our way towards it..
