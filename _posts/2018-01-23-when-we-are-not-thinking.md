We have always been more than our thoughts,
and we have always known this,
when we were not thinking.

There is so much that we know,
when we are not thinking,
that goes unnoticed in our memories,
unindexed by analysis or judgement,
unremarked in our internal conversation,
but simply lived and experienced.

We were born this way,
drinking everything in,
content to not understand,
to rejoice in life itself,
not in the story about it.
