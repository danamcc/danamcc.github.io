Are we born 
already knowing
all we need to know
to be happy?

Were all these years I've spent
striving for understanding
merely a distraction,
avoiding the simplicity of being,
afraid to surrender
to what already is?

What compelled me
to build these edifices,
these walls 
against the rawness
of naked truth,
when it is only my resistance 
that chafes me,
not the truth itself?

Before we learned to doubt,
did not nature
nurture us completely,
absent the demons
that our restless minds conjure?

Are we not born
into paradise,
but with the power
to imagine Hell?

Can we not, then,
imagine our way
back from our fever dreams,
and back to the heaven
from which we came?
