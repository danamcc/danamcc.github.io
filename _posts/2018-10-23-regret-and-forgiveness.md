title: Regret and Forgiveness

In all these years
of striving to be human,
I have caused myself
no end of suffering,
needlessly repeating
the doubts and fears
born of an overactive mind.

I regret the pain
I have caused myself,
and I forgive myself 
for causing it.

Regret and forgiveness
are my blessings.

Without regret,
I would forget 
that all my suffering
need never have been,
if I had seen 
that it was all my own creation.
 
And without forgiveness,
I would forget 
that I have always been worthy
of the peace that comes
when doubts and fears dwindle,
and the suffering ceases.
