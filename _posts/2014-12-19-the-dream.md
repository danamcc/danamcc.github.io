We are born into suffering,
Thrust out of amniotic bliss
into chaos and light -
a dream of separation.

We search our whole lives
for wholeness remembered,
womb of the Mother,
womb of Spirit.

In this dream of separation,
each moment seems severed
from where we are from,
where we long to be,
our birthright of completeness.

We look to the world around us,
seeking what seems missing inside,
until that moment of awakening,
when we find ourselves, complete,
as we have always Been.
