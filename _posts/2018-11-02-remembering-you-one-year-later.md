Our purpose in life
is not to hold on,
but to let go,
enjoying each moment
as best we can,
sharing our joy
as much as we can.

And the way to let go
is to just stop holding on,
to give up grasping so tightly
at the myth of safety and security.

There is no effort in letting go,
just a giving up of effort,
an abandonment of fear,
a surrender to what is.

The purpose of your life
was not to hold on,
but to let go
and surrender to what is,
always determined
to enjoy each moment,
and to share your joy 
with us all.
