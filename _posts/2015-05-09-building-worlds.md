title: Building Worlds
category: life

Writers take their hopes and fears  
and build worlds,  
making them real  
on the printed page.  
  
And the rest of us?  
We build worlds  
with our hopes and fears  
inside our minds,  
and make them real.  
  
Knowing this,  
it is our choice  
to build worlds  
worth living in.
