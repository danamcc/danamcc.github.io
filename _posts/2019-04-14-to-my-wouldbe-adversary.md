If you feel wronged by me,
here is my advice to you:
refrain from making me a villian,
or making yourself a victim.

The hurt you feel now
is but a vestige
of something old and festering,
triggered by your present perception,
but grounded in past pain.

By seeing me
as the cause of your torment,
you only give your power away,
depriving yourself of the possibility 
of moving on.

I have never wished you ill,
nor will I ever,
and I forgive you
for the suffering you have caused
while blinded by your own pain.

My wish for you is simple:
that you may learn from this,
as I have,
and that this may be the beginning
of your healing.
