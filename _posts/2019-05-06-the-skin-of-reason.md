Ever entranced 
by the pull of words,
clothing everything
in the skin of reason,
I have been lulled to sleep 
by my life's routines, 
sheilding me 
from the rawness of the world,
and the fearful intimacy 
of its embrace.

And when I awaken
from my dream of the familiar,
I am like a newborn,
a tourist in my own world,
delighting in its newness;
stripped of its history, 
pulsing with life.
