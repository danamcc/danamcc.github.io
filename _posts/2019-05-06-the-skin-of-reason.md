Ever entranced 
by the pull of words,
I have been lulled to sleep 
by my life's routines, 
clothing everything
in the skin of reason,
shielding me 
from the rawness of the world
and the fearful intimacy 
of its embrace.

And when I awaken
from my dream of the familiar,
I stand naked
like a newborn,
a tourist in my own world,
delighting in its newness,
its immediacy,
devoid of history, 
pulsing with life.
