Asleep in my life's routine, 
I am lulled by the pull
to wrap everything in words,
to clothe my experience
in the skin of reason,
as if to protect myself
from the rawness of the world,
fearing the intimacy
of its embrace.

And when I awaken
from this dream of the familiar,
I am reborn,
like a tourist in my own world,
ecstatically awash
in the  newness of everything,
stripped of history, 
naked of interpretation,
pulsing with life.
