We are born big, 
born of Spirit,
and we have always known this.

Born into little bodies,
we learn to think small,
becoming less than we were
(and we have always known that).

Straining at our boundaries,
we yearn for more,
as if there were a greater world
(which we have always known).

Exploring the borders 
of our own conceptions,
we break through, 
we are home,
in a place we have always known.
