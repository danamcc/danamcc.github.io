If you were naked beside me,  
I would nurture you  
In every inch of your body.  
I would love each curve and crevasse,  
As I love myself,  
As I love this life.

Your skin would be my road,  
Your breasts, my hills and valleys,  
The space between your thighs,  
My resting place.

Your beating heart would be my song,  
Your pulse, my dance.  
Your climb to ecstasy would be my prayer,  
And your release, my answer.
