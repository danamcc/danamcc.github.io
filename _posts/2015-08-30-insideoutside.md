Inside/Outside  
  
There is no "inside".  
  
In the mind's eye,  
things arrange themselves  
like nesting boxes,  
or branching trees,  
or trains of things   
and thoughts.  
  
In the hierarchy of ideas,  
everything exists  
Inside of, or outside of,  
next to, or away from,  
under, or above,  
everything else.  
  
But, beyond the mind  
Is the Great Soup of Being.  
  
It is not inside the mind,  
or outside;  
there is no "inside",  
there is no "outside",  
there simply is.
