When a train of thought begins,  
it has no tracks,  
unless you lay them down.

Each one is like a puff of smoke,  
leading nowhere,  
unless, with our attention,  
we let them lead us  
where they will.

Without the engine of thought,  
pulling us down its narrow paths,  
our ways are infinite,  
our possibilities endless.
