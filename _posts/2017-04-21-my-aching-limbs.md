My aching limbs remind me,
at the end of each day,
what I could have avoided doing,
but chose to do, instead.

The aching of my limbs
is the price my body pays,
day by day,
for being who I want to be,
as entropy ticks out 
the minutes, days, and years
of my life.

My aching limbs admonish me
that each day is a gift,
not to be taken for granted.

The aching of my limbs
reminds me
of another day
worth living.
