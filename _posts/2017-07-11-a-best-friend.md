Become a friend to yourself,
and you will never be alone.

Give to yourself
all the love,
all the support
that you would give
to your dearest friend.

Withhold your judgements
and your blame,
as you would
for a beloved friend.

Be a source of comfort,
offering compassion
and understanding
in your darkest times.

Give yourself
what you have always hoped
someone else would give you,
and you will always be complete.
