I am consciousness;
I move around a lot.

Sometimes
I am human,
or I'm a dog or a cat,
a rat, or a rock.

As I move from form to form,
I don't remember what it's like 
to look through each pair of eyes,
or feel what each body feels.

All I remember
is how rich it is
to be alive,
and how grateful I am,
just to be.
