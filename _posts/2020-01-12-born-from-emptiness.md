title: Born from emptiness
---
I was born from emptiness, 
and to emptiness,
someday,
I will return. 

The more I look 
into that darkness, 
the more I see 
the birthplace of everything, 
where everything must also return. 

And when that day arrives, 
I need not fear being thrust 
into a strange, forbidding place.

I will be going home.￼￼
