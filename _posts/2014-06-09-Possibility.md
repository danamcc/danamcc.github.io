<pre>
it's nice to love you,
    like 2 babies in a crib,
        smiling, playing,
             looking, touching.

               no ideas, no hope, no worries;
            no future, no theories;
          no reasons,
       no blame.

a beloved face,
        a delightful sound:
               your voice,
a gentle touch: your skin,
        a soothing warmth:
                your heart.

        I see that child in you,
                tender, defenseless;
                        I look deeper -
                                I see my soul, 
				      the soul we share.
