The sky is my Gohonzon. 

As a train of clouds  
roll by the moon,  
tuft upon tuft   
of vapor   
passing by,  
each one is like a bead  
of my heartâ€™s rosary.

My prayer is to be part of this,  
to sink into its center,  
embedded in it,  
empowered by its  
infinite energy,  
to BE what I am seeing,

And I am!
