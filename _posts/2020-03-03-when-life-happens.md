title: When Life Happens

At any given moment,
disaster may strike, 
and I might be 
in its midst,
or, just as easily, 
at its periphery,
a horrified bystander.
​
Or I may likewise be
enveloped in some great joy,
gratefully accepting
life’s surprising beneficence.
​
In these moments,
all my expectations 
will come to nothing.
​
So I will learn to let them go,
and be alert and ready
when life happens.
