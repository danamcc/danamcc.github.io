title: When Life Happens

At any given moment,
disaster may strike, 
and I could be at it’s epicenter,
or, just as easily, at its periphery,
a horrified bystander.

Or I may likewise be
enveloped in some great joy,
a grateful recipient
of life’s surprising beneficence.

And in these moments,
all my expectations 
will come to nothing.

So I will learn to let them go,
and be alert and ready
when life happens.
