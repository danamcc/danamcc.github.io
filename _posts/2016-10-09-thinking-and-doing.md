To think about doing something  
and to actually do it  
are two different worlds.  
  
First, there is the conversation,  
sometimes endless,  
about pros and cons,  
and then there is   
the simple act of doing.  
  
When the conversation falls away,  
action flows effortlessly,  
as if energy and skillfulness  
are what we swim in,  
when we awaken to it.
