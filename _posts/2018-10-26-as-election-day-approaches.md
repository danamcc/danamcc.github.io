There are those in our government
who have no concern 
for our wellbeing,
but only for their own.

They are drunk on power,
guarding their interests
with every ounce of control
they can manage,
twisting the narrative
of what concerns us all
to their own advantage,
serving only those
who serve them.

Their weapons are words,
levers to pry away our reason,
flames to ignite our fears.

But words are only dangerous
when they are believed,
supplanting our natural knowing
of what is right and wrong.

We are not helpless,
when we listen carefully,
follow our hearts,
and step up when we are called,
to use our citizenship
as it was meant to be used,
and express our will
as a people.
