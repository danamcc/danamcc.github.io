Why does the news
read like the script
of a cheap soap opera?

Why does this drama 
of clashing opinions
draw us in
to this vortex of judgements,
this cauldron of conflict?

Why are we seduced
by these delicious fabrications,
stoking the flames of our indignation,
stroking our sense of righteousness?

Why do we accept
the fodder we are fed
by those who would buy our attention?

Not because we seek the truth,
but because we are addicted
to living in a world,
an interactive fiction,
in which we are always right.
