### A Reflection

There was a moment  
when we shared being,  
with a word,  
with silence.

Sinking past separateness,  
egos relaxing,  
we discovered ourselves  
in each other.

### Another Reflection

What do we protect,  
when we protect ourselves?  
The fragile shell of "me"  
against the dangerous waters of "you",  
the pushes and shoves of identity  
pressing for primacy,  
each "I' a bubble imagined,  
guarding its perimeter,  
in a limitless sea.
