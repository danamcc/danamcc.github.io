Love 
is accepting someone 
or something, 
exactly as they are.

Love is celebrating
your connection with them,
and their own uniqueness.

Love is accepting
that everything changes,
and that each object of our love
eventually passes out of our lives,
as all things 
flow in and out of being.

Love is cherishing 
what we have,
content and grateful,
not demanding more.
