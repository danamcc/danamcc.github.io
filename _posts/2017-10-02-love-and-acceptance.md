Love is completely accepting 
someone or something, 
exactly as they are.

Love is celebrating
your connection with them,
and their uniqueness.

Love is accepting
that everything changes,
and that each object of our love
eventually passes out of our lives,
just in the natural flow of things.

Love is cherishing 
what we have,
content and grateful,
not demanding more.
