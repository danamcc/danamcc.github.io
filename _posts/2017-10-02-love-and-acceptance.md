To love someone 
or something,
is to accept them totally,  
exactly as they are.

It is celebrating
your connection with them,
and the subtle differences
that make them unique.

Love is accepting
that everything changes;
that the objects of our love
will eventually leave us,
in the natural flow 
of living and dying.

Love is cherishing 
the gifts of each moment,
being grateful and content;
not demanding more.
