I do not believe in God,
and I do not believe in air.

Yet,
I trust that there are things
I cannot see and hear
which shape the world around me.

Many teachers,
scientists and mystics,
have pointed the way,
and, at times,
my own senses
have confirmed their wisdom.

I do not believe in air,
yet that is the sea
I live and swim in.

So it is with Spirit,
which some call God,
always with us,
around us,
in us,
whatever it is called.
