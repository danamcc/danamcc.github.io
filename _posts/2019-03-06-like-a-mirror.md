Seeing the negativity in another
is like a mirror.

It wouldn't hurt so much
if it didn't touch that raw space
in ourselves,
where our own demons hide.

It can be a little epiphany,
if we allow it to be,
a chance to to cast off 
another layer of denial,
to lay bare our own hurt,
so we can begin to heal.
