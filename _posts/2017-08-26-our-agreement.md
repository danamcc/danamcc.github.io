When we come together 
to drum and dance,
it is our agreement,
unspoken among us,
to abandon our apparent differences,
and to celebrate 
all that connects us.

In this sacred circle,
we agree to talk 
only through our drumming,
and not with our words;
not as individuals,
but only as one being.

We agree to focus 
on communicating 
through our rhythms,
with which we share 
this sacred space,
and not through a cell phone
(that digital garden of ego),
with those whose approval
we so habitually seek.

We agree to set aside 
this sense of "me",
if only for the moment,
and, immersed in this rhythmic communion,
to allow ourselves to melt back 
to our common source,
where all there is
is "us".
