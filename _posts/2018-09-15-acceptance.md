I have wasted so much time
trying to please the people 
in my life,
trying to please myself.

I have forgotten 
that I have been given 
the privilege of being alive,
and that it is sufficient
to be myself,
regardless of the thoughts 
of anyone,
including myself.

The gift of being 
is not to be won
through popularity
or appeasement;
it is given unconditionally,
by whatever drives this universe,
and it is only won
through the act of acceptance.
