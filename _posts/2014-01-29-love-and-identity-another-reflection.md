[love and Identity - A Reflection]({{site.base.url}}/love/2014/01/29/love-and-identity-a-reflection/)

What do we protect,  
when we protect ourselves?  
The fragile shell of "me"  
against the dangerous waters of "you",  
the pushes and shoves of identity  
pressing for primacy,  
each "I' a bubble imagined,  
guarding its perimeter,  
in a limitless sea.
