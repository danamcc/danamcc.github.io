what does it take
to feel truly alive?

stop,
wherever you are,
and look around you,
and see everything
as if youâ€™ve never 
seen it before.

see it without words,
without a history
for each thing.

then you will not
be living in a story,
and life will not
be separate from you.

your life will fall away,
and you will just
be life.
