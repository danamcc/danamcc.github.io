In the mind's eye,
things arrange themselves
like nesting boxes,
or branching trees,
or trains of things
and thoughts.

In the hierarchy of ideas,
everything exists
Inside of, or outside of,
next to, or away from,
under, or above,
everything else.

But, beyond the mind
Is the Great Soup of Being.

It is not inside the mind,
or outside;
there is no "inside",
there is no "outside",
there simply is.
