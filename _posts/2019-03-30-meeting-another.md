How do we meet someone in neutrality,
and let our natural love for another being flow freely?

How do we scrape away the film of illusion
that obscures each person we meet
behind a wall of our own projections?

How can we let our attractions and aversions fall away,
to reveal a fellow being that stands before us?

How long will it take to see through these questions
to the truth behind them:
that all that separates us from another
is the interference of our own thoughts?
