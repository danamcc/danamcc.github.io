How do we meet another in neutrality,
so our natural love may flow freely?

How do we scrape away the film of illusion
that hides each person we meet
behind a wall of our own projections?

How do we see through our attractions and aversions
to reveal the fellow being that stands before us?

How long will it take 
to see beyond these questions
to the truth behind them,
that all that separates us from each other
is the interference of our own thoughts?
