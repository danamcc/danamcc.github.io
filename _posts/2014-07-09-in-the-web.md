In the web of being,
There are more directions
Than we can ever know.

Our eyes see only up and down,
Left and right, front and back.

Our spirits see everywhere,
When we choose to look.

In the sea of our infinite souls,
All things that can happen DO happen.

When we shift our focus, we see them,
Just beyond where we usually look.

To earthbound eyes,
Point of view is everything.

Spirit shows us where to look.
