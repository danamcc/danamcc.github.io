In the web of being,   
There are more directions  
Than we can ever know.

Our eyes see only up and down,  
Left and right, front and back.

Our spirits see everywhere,  
When we choose to look.

In the sea of our infinite souls,  
All things that can happen DO happen.

When we shift our focus, they are seen,   
Just beyond where we usually look.

To earthbound eyes,   
point of view is everything;   
Spirit can show us where to look.
