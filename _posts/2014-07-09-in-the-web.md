In the web of our being,  
There are more directions  
Than we can know.

Our eyes see only up and down,  
Left and right, front and back.

Our spirits see everywhere,  
When we look there.

In the sea of our infinite souls,  
All things that can happen DO happen.

They can be seen when we shift our attention,  
Just beyond where we usually look.

To earthbound eyes,  
Point of view is everything.

Spirit can show us  
Where to look.
