There are things 
we like to have and do,
and things 
we like to avoid.

And suddenly,
life will change the menu,
honing down our options,
to a whole new set
of “cans” and “can’ts”.

And in these times,
we may suffer greatly,
constrained within our little boxes,
unless we learn to stretch and bend
with life’s openings and closings,
to be as flexible and resilient
as is life itself.
