You stand at peace,
in total concentration,
rooted like a tree,
firm in your vision.

Out of stillness,
birthed in your intention,
grows each perfect action,
unfolding, with nature's grace.

Each motion is a word
in the poetry of cause and effect,
a step in the dance of matter,
a note in the song of energy.

It is Being taking form,
the Ideal becoming real,
flowing through you,
body, mind, and Spirit.
