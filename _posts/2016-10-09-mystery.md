Our myths are our striving  
to explain the inexplicable.   
  
Craving understanding,  
we build mechanisms of magic,  
make miracles out of the mundane.  
  
But what if everything that is  
IS magical,   
and each moment of life  
a miracle?  
  
Abandoning our stories,  
is it not more glorious  
to stand in wonder,  
sinking deeper into mystery,  
the more we look?
