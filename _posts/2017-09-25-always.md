I am not the person
I was yesterday.

I am wearing his shoes,
breathing in his body,
living in his house.

These are the gifts 
I walk around this world with,
gratefully;
but they are not me.

Each day, 
as I wake up, 
I am someone new.

Heir to the memories
of past days,
I am born into the present,
breathing its air,
walking its paths.

It is a world
I have never lived in,
and never will again.

It is the world
I always live in,
and always will.
