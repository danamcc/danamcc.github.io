On a road  
we often travel,  
each intersection  
offers options:  
the path well known,  
paved by habit,  
or a turn  
not yet taken.

Mostly,  
we forge ahead,  
asleep at the wheel,  
lulled by the familiar.

Until,  
in an unexpected moment,  
we are startled awake  
by the vividness of choice,  
the freedom of the new.  

Then,  
a universe opens,  
our vision clear.

Until we see where we are,  
we cannot see the way ahead,  
blinded by where weâ€™ve been.
