We strive after peak experiences,  
forgetting that the perfection we're looking for  
is already with us, and in us, whether we feel it or not. 

Simply remembering this can ease the pressure we put on ourselves,  
so we can just relax into our own being, warts and all. 

Maybe that's as good as it gets!
