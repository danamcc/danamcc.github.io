The times i am happiest
are the times i am not "me".

Sometimes,
there are just my eyes seeing, 
my ears hearing,
or my hands playing,
with no one there,
no thoughts
to guide them.

Without a history,
without a reason,
there is only a witness
to the richness of experience,
to life's gifts, 
momentary and eternal,
little and big.
