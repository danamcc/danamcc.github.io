_for Kerry_

Every face 
is a facet
of the face of God.

And there are faces
that shine with a special light,
a reflection of what shines
within us all.

When such a soul 
passes from this world,
it is our  reminder 
that God's face can be glimpsed  
in every being around us,
and that we are all blessed
to be in such company.
