Enlightenment 
is like a clear sky,
pure and cloudless.

We may experience it
in the gaps 
between our cloudy thoughts,
our dreams of identity,
fear, and craving.

And we may widen those gaps,
through patient concentration,
seeing what obscures them
as the phantoms they are.

Most likely, 
we will never see that cloudless sky
in its pristine entirety,
but we can be blessed 
by the taste of it,
and the grace of knowing 
it is there.
