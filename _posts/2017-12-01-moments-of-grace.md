Sometimes 
we are visited by Grace,
and we glide through each moment 
with peaceful ease.

Sometimes, 
we feel the sting of ego,
like a hungry insect 
puncturing our serenity,
poisoning our sense
of who we are.

And always,
through all our moments
of peace or struggle,
there is that which watches,
from deep within,
ready to accept it all
with equanimity.

And that, too
(when we are moved
to watch what watches),
is Grace.
