When I open myself up,
sadness sometimes creeps in,
old stories of defeat and regret,
the pain of unmet expectations 
lurking always in the background,
the underbelly of my experience.

And then there is this richness, 
the immediacy of all that bathes my senses
when I turn my full attention 
to what is happening around me,
and then the sadness drifts away,
like a cloud dispersing,
and I am back 
where I belong.
