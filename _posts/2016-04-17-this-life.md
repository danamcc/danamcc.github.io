This life of mine  
does not live up  
to my expectations.  
  
I am blindsided  
by tragedies   
and disappointments,  
not expected,  
and not wanted.  
  
And likewise,  
I am lifted up  
by joyful surprises,  
lifeâ€™s unexpected gifts.   
   
Freed of expectations,  
this life is a wondrous trip,  
full of ups and downs,  
and always    
worth the ride.
