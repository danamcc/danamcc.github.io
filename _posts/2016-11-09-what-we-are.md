_A Postscript to the Election:_

Now is the time to be strong, 
to look inside 
for what does not depend 
on outside circumstance,
for that which does not change
as lifeâ€™s calamities 
and disappointments 
roll past us,
that which is beyond fear or hope,
that which is eternal and inherent,
which cannot be diminished,
because that is what we are.
