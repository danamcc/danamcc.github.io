When you hear yourself
being critical of yourself,
you may ask yourself:
who are these selves,
and why must they bicker
amongst themselves
inside my brain?

What if they spoke 
with kindness and respect,
or ceased to speak at all?

What if you, yourself,
ceased to listen,
withdrawing your interest
and your belief in them
(which are the fuel
that gives them form),
and you let them fade,
bit by bit,
into vapor,
into nothingness?
