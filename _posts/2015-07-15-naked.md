We are born naked,  
without disguise.  
  
And then,  
as we learn to walk and talk,  
to grasp at what we want,  
we clothe ourselves In Ego,  
moving through the world  
with the shroud of "I" around us,  
Safe, separate, and alone.  
  
Oh,  
To walk this world  
naked one more time,  
stripped of expectations,  
me dissolving into everyone  
and everything,  
newborn once again.  
  
- D. McCurdy
