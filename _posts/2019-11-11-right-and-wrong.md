There is a certain thrill 
in feeling right, 
when the ego swells with pride, 
extolling itself 
at the expense of another.

Sometimes the hunt 
for right and wrong
is not a search for truth,
but only a struggle
for a stronger sense of self.


And perhaps 
there are no bad people -
only bad ideas.

Treat those you disagree with
with compassion and respect,
and perhaps your words will reach them,
and maybe even help to heal
their own troubled, toxic thoughts.
