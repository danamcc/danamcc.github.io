### Opening

<pre class="whitespaced-text">
it's nice to love you,
    like 2 babies in a crib,
        smiling, playing,
             looking, touching.

               no ideas, no hope or worries;
            no future, no theories;
          no reasons,
       no blame.

a beloved face,
        a delightful sound:
               your voice,
a gentle touch: your skin,
        a soothing warmth:
                your heart.

I see the child in you,
        tender and defenseless;
                I look deeper,
                        and see my soul, 
      the soul we share.
### Possibility
</pre>
It's nice to love you,  
expecting nothing.  
Naivete leaves me;  
dreams disperse,   
dew-like.

Itâ€™s just me, in my life,  
seeing you, in yours.  
Our paths veer   
like mountain roads,  
diverging, colliding,  
sometimes touching, gently,   
for a moment or two.

This does not fit in any box I know;  
these moments pop into being, and pass.  
There is a flow  
that cannot be followed.  
These are our paths,  
not to understand,  
but simply to be open to their grace.

These are blessings beyond reason.  
I accept them.
