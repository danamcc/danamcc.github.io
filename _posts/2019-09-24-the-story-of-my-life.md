As I think about the aches and pains
of my daily life, as time creeps on,
they form a story of entropy,
which leads inexorably
to the story’s end.

Nothing lasts forever,
and so the story goes,
that one day
there will be a future
that I’m not in.

So I am left with the present,
alive and able to respond
to life’s vicissitudes,
free each day
to remake the story of my life,
choosing anew
what makes it worth living.
