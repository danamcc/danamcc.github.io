title: The Good and the Difficult
category: life
---

You mentioned our friendship   
and all the wonderful things   
we were able to share,   
the good and the difficult.  
  
They are both gifts:  
it's the good that reminds us   
how joyful life can be,   
and the difficult that reminds us   
how we can learn and grow.
