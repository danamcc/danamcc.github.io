In most moments,  
we live in little locked rooms,  
apartments of the mind,  
cluttered with memories  
and judgements.

Adrift in a pool  
of thoughts and fears,  
we tread water,  
almost drowning. 

And then,   
sometimes,  
the walls split wide,  
and we float free,  
with no myths to hold us.

Unbounded   
by our own descriptions,  
we are nothing,  
and everything,  
seeing itself.
