title: Sitting Here

I sit here, 
the sound of rain 
gently tapping 
on the metal shell
surrounding me,
the vehicle I sit in
otherwise inert
and silent.

Bereft of its function
as a means for moving,
how peaceful it becomes, 
not as a machine,
but as a place of quiet, 
restful and undemanding. 

What an unexpected gift,
to be here 
with nothing needing to be done,
peacefully enjoying 
the subtle pleasures 
of just sitting here.
