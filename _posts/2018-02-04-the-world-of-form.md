There is a sublime order to this world
which we can never fully see
or fully understand.

Yet we are moved 
by glimpses of its essence,
inspired by its outlines,
dimly perceived
by our mortal eyes.

And so we paint 
our imperfect pictures,
construct our flawed philosophies,
aspiring to the grandeur
of what is just beyond us.

Bound in this bodily realm,
we strain to see 
beyond our senses,
conceive of what our minds
cannot contain.

We are cursed 
by our human form,
and we are blessed 
by our human spirit.
