Breathing in,  
I receive the gift of life.  
  
Breathing out,  
I share this gift.  
  
For every breath we take in,  
there are countless creatures,  
those who crawl and walk,  
swim and fly,  
who are likewise gifted.  
  
And every breath we give out  
gives life to countless others,  
growing in green profusion,   
breathing in  
what we breathe out,  
all in perfect balance.
