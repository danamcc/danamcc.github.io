Breathing in,  
I receive the gift of life.  
  
Breathing out,  
I share this gift.  
  
For every breath we take in,  
there are countless creatures,  
those who crawl and walk,  
swim and fly,  
likewise gifted.  
  
And every breath we give out  
gives life to countless others,  
those who grow  
in green profusion,  
all in perfect balance.
