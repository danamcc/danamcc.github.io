I may like to think
that I'm smart,
but not everything I do
is smart.

I may like to think
that I'm kind,
but not everything I do
is kind.

I may like to think
that I'm mindful,
but I am often
not mindful.

Maybe what I am
is not always
what I like to think I am,
but is always only
what I choose to be
in that particular moment,
when I remember
that I have a choice.
