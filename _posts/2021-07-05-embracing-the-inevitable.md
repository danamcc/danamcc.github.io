_There is no way to know what life will bring,
but there IS a way to be ready for it._

Why do we try so hard
to avoid the inevitable?

Embrace it,
and a door will open
to all things possible.

There will be pain
and discomfort,
sadness and regret.

And there will also be
the boundless joy
of feeling fully alive.

Some things 
canâ€™t be fixed.

All we can do
is accept the pain,
and learn,
and heal.
