Spiritual seekers   
tend to deify their teachers,   
attributing Godly powers to them. 

And yet, a true teacher   
is simply a facilitator,   
one who makes the process   
of learning easier. 

A teacher is a bridge   
between the teachings and the student,   
a lens to bring the truth into focus,   
so it can be seen more clearly,   
and assimilated more completely. 

Our great teachers   
deserve our greatest gratitude,  
our greatest respect,   
for their humbleness,   
and for their skill,   
insight, and passion.
