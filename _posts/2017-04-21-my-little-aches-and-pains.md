My little aches and pains 
remind me,
at the end of the day,
what I could have avoided doing,
but chose to do, instead.

These little aches and pains
are the price my body paid
for being who I want to be,
each day,
as entropy ticks out 
the minutes, days, and years
of my life.

These little aches and pains
awaken me, some days,
reminding me of the choice
that every day offers me.

These little aches and pains 
admonish me
that each day is a gift,
that it is not 
to be taken for granted.

These little aches and pains 
remind me
of another day
worth living.
