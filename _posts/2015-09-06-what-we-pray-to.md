What We Pray To

Every “ism”
is a map,
a path
from where we think we are
to where we always are,
where we have forgotten.

And, when we stand there,
awakened,
if only for a moment,
there is nothing to follow,
no goal to pursue.

We stand
in an infinite kingdom,
free to wander,
at home
in an endless garden.
