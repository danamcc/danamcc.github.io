A virus
is just a molecule
that wants to be alive.

It will stop at nothing,
mindlessly striving
to hijack life 
for its own ends.

As we hunker down,
waiting for its reign to pass,
there is time to consider
how our own selfish genes
have run rampant over other life,
causing needless suffering
throughout the ages.

A virus has no mind,
but each of us, 
its distant cousin,
has been gifted one.

And so, 
while we may not lay blame 
on the humble virus 
for its rapacious mindlessness,
should we not consider
our own?
