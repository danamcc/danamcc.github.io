title: Spirit Peeks Through

We cover the world with concepts,  
Wrapping ourselves in words,  
Sleeping in a bed of history,  
Dreaming out our lives.

And sometimes the veil tears open  
And our visions are blinded in light,  
And spirit peeks through, like a newborn,  
Looking out through our eyes.
