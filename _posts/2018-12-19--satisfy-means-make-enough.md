When there is a nagging feeling
of what is missing,
when a stream of thoughts say
"this or that is not enough",
there can be no peace
in any moment.

only when the chain of thought
is seen and broken,
the lie revealed for what it is,
can the little things that fill our lives
suddenly be satisfying.
