THE POWER OF ONE (33 Steps)  
  
To bring peace to the world  
may seem an impossible task.   
  
Yet, to bring peace to oneself  
is doable.  
  
And if,  
having found peace,  
each one would share it  
with two others,  
who would each share  
with two more,  
where would it end?  
  
Just as our cells replicate  
in their exponential dance,  
so could the peace   
of one human soul spread   
to encompass everyone.  
  
As 2 becomes 4,  
and 4 becomes 8,  
there are only  
THIRTY THREE steps  
between peace for one,  
and peace for everyone.
