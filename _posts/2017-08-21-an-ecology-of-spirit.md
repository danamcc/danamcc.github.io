_A reflection on how we use the gift of social media_

The most powerful question I have ever heard
is "Where are you directing your energy?".

Every word, or thought, or image
that we add to the informational soup
becomes part of this sea of ideas
we all swim and breathe in.

Just as our oceans 
become befouled
with our waste,
so does our virtual sea
grow murky and toxic
with a million tokens 
of emotional violence
tossed carelessly into its depths.

And just as the Earth, 
our Mother,
has graced us 
with this beautiful 
and nurturing home,
so has our own genius
bequeathed us these digital waters,
in which we are privileged  
to share a world
of feelings and ideas.

So, as we each drift 
in our little boats of identity,
there is a chance, each time, 
before we toss 
our mental progeny
into the depths around us,
to stop and wonder,
"If this were the only thing 
that comprised this sea,
would this be the kind of sea 
I would choose
for myself and others
to swim in?"
