What if the stars and planets,
as they spin around our sky,
have no more effect on our lives
than the breath of a butterfly,
twelve thousand miles away?

What if this dance,
infinite in its grace
and its complexity,
embraces the intricate chaos 
around us,
shaping our experiences,
without limiting them?

And what if there is no cause
for our particular predicament,
but the collisions of our fears
with the quantum dance of chance,
in this infinite universe
among infinite universes?

What if karma, itself,
is not a mechanism,
but a dance?
