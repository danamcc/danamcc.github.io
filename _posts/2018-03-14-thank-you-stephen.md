Sitting in that chair,
body almost broken,
your mind and spirit soared,
way beyond 
what most of us 
can ever see.

You made your life a gift 
to all the world,
accepting the gift
of your own life
without regret.

And now
your crooked body
has finished its brief trip
through time,
as the blinding light
that was your brilliance
shines on,
timelessly.
