We are all ignorant,
in one way or another.

There are those of us
who are unaware
of their own ignorance,
and those who are complacent
in their ignorance.

And there are those
who revel in their ignorance,
and some who promote
the ignorance of others.

Ignorance is comfortable,
until it is examined;
we are either part of the problem,
or part of the solution.
