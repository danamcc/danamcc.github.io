I have waited too long
for the world to be
just as I thought it ought to be.
 
I have let my happiness depend
on what goes on around me;
I have given up my power
to the vagaries of circumstance.

So now, I place my trust 
in the world within,
at the center of infinity,
where everything is possible,
and already perfect,
just as it is.
