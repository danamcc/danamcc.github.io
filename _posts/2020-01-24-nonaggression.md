I am signing 
a nonaggression pact 
with myself. 

No more 
will I try to fix 
what I fear is broken.

No more will I judge 
what I don't understand, 
or resist what I am 
uncomfortable with.

I am promising 
to embrace whatever may come, 
to accept it as gift, 
to trust in the wisdom 
that lives in me 
and in everything around me.
