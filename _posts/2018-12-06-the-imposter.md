I have always felt
I was an imposter,
insufficient to the task
of being who I thought I should be.

Now, 
as the illusion
of being someone in particular
slowly slips away from me,
I see the pointlessness
of trying to be anyone.

My story is irrelevant;
I exist 
beyond the flow
of what was
or what may be;
I am only real
in this eternal Now.
