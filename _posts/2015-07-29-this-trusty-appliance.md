title: This Trusty Appliance
category: life
---

This body that I live in
is like a faithful toaster,
a trusty appliance
that has served me well.

If my toaster broke,
I would say a quick farewell,
and buy another,
or do without toast,
at least for a while.

Can I let go of this “me”
as easily,
when my time has come,
floating on
to What’s Next?
