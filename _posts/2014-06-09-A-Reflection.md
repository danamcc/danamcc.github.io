Human beings are, for the most part, unreliable.  
Pinning one's hopes on the actions of another is almost always a mistake.  
The one relationship we can and must rely on is with ourself.  
All the nurturing and guidance we really need is within.  
What we see in others is simply a mirror of what is in ourselves.
