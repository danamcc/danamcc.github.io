Now that the breath of life has left you,
now that your bones are ash,
still your crooked smile will linger,
emblazoned in my memory,
shining in my heart.

It will be the last of you to fade,
but only when I too am gone,
along with all the others
who have known you,
loved you.

We will all be dust one day,
but, as we roam the hills and valleys
of our own allotted space and time, 
there will always be the beacon
of your crooked smile.
