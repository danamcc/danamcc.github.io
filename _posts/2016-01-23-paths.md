ï»¿Your path is not my path,  
and my path is not yours.

When we met,  
there was  
that synergy  
in the moment,  
energies combined.
At those crossroads,  
everything   
seems possible,  
choices  
upon choices.
And, yet,  moving on,  we each chose
our own way,  
loyal  
to our own truth,  
willing to let go  
of what led elsewhere.
We move on.
