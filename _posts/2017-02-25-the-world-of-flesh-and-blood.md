in the world of flesh and blood,
there are always itches 
to be scratched,
holes to be filled;
fears to be quelled,
urges to be satisfied.

in the world of spirit,
they are only dreams,
fleeting images,
coming and going
in the flow of time.

None are real,
none are lasting.

They are mirages,
shadows cast
by clouded vision,
seen into existence
by the stubborn persistence
of thought.

In the world of presence,
they will fade,
dissolving
into the light.
