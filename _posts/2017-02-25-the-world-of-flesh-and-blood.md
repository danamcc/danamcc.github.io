in the world of flesh and blood,
there are always itches to be scratched,
holes to be filled;
fears to be quelled,
urges to be satisfied.

in the world of spirit,
these are only flimsy dreams,
fleeting images,
coming and going
in the flow of time.

They are mirages,
shadows cast by clouded vision,
seen into existence
by the stubborn persistence of thinking.

In the world of presence,
they will quickly fade,
dissolving into the light.
