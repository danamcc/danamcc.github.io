Tender and strong,
Gentle and tough,
Standing solid and open.
Accepting, ready.

Dancing in lightness,
Flowing past the sofa,
Lifted by music,
Your smile floating by.

Steadfast and tranquil,
Eyes ahead,
Feet firmly flowing,
Communing with the sand.

Curled as in birth,
Gentle and yielding,
Reaching softly,
Body and spirit.
