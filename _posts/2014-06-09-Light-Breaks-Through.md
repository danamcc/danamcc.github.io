title: Light Breaks Through
category: Being Human

Heart heavy,  
Mind full of anger & hurt,  
I walk along  
in my own dark story.

Then  
light breaks through.  
The city, the river,  
Awash with sun,  
call me.

I listen, I see.  
This moment,  
This gift,  
THIS is real.

Then the sun sets.  
The sky blooms.  
Another gift,  
Another moment.
