Sometimes my mind roams
like a restless animal,
darting from thought to thought,
in a frenzy of unease.

Seeking calm,
I try to quiet it,
to reign it in,
like an unruly child.

And all my effort
only feeds resistance,
my thoughts running faster
as I chase after them.

Until I find the patience 
of a loving guardian,
allowing my monkey mind its freedom,
watching with compassion
as it winds its way down to silence,
and rests peacefully 
beside me.
