Hopes and dreams
are what make us human,
and give our lives direction.

And they can lead us astray,
when we forget the difference
between what is
and what we dream and hope for.

To face reality,
and accept it for what it is,
is to stand on solid ground,
a place to start from,
towards wherever
we would like to go.
