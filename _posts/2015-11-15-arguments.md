Arguments

When the two sides
of an argument
clash so vehemently,
perhaps the problem lies
in the premise that
there ARE two sides.

Perhaps the truth
is too complex
to be seen whole
from any one
point of view.

The mindâ€™s urge
to polarize,
to think always
in black and white,
in right and wrong,
can be our downfall.
