Embracing emptiness
is not the same 
as succumbing to nothingness.

It is cleaning the closet of the mind,
until it is a clear space,
like an open sky
through which clouds of thought
may come and go, 
without lingering,
without clutter.

It is like standing 
in an open field,
inspiring in its grandeur,
and pregnant 
with possibilities.
