There is no God,
and there is nothing
which is not God.

God is in a sunset,
as God is in a piece of shit.

Everything that grows
is God,
and everything that decays
is also God.

God surrounds us,
suffuses us,
is us.

There is no God
who watches us;
we are the eyes of God,
the eyes of the universe,
knowing itself.
