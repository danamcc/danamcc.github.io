Love is not desire
for someone
or something.

It is being open
for giving 
and receiving,
without hopes
or expectations.

Love is not wanting;
wanting is only 
imagined need,
for whatever 
we seem to lack.

But to love 
is to feel complete,
to celebrate
what we already have,
what we already are,
which connects us
to everyone
and everything.
