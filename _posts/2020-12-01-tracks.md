You might as well
try to steer a train
as try to control 
your life.

Trust the tracks
that chance and karma
have laid down for you,
and be ever alert 
for moments of mindful action,
when you may switch 
to a different path,
or choose to slow down,
or speed up,
or stop.

In all your other moments,
learn to sit back
and enjoy the ride.
