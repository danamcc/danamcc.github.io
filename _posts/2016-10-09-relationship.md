We have pushed each other’s buttons,
touched each other’s wounds,
so many times,
until there comes a time
to ask forgiveness,
and to forgive.

We have blundered
into relationship,
craving surcease,
not seeing the other’s pain.

Seeing this,
Is it kinder to walk away,
or to face each other,
raw and open,
meeting in fellowship?

The answer
may be hard to know,
but may be found
through courage
and compassion.
