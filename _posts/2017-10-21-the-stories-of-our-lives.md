The stories of our lives
are not our lives.

They are merely 
what we tell ourselves
about moments past,
or moments that might be.

We spend our lives in these dreams,
revising and embellishing them,
like re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic,
never realizing that,
if the ship of our identity 
would dissolve around us,
we would not drown!

These are the worlds we live in, 
when we forget the present moment,
forgetting to be here, 
now.
