The peace we seek
comes from within.

There is nothing we can do,
nothing we can create,
and nothing we can attract,
that will bring peace to us.

Until we see the peace within,
there will be no peace for us.

There will only be frustration,
and the lingering hope
that peace will come 
from outside us,
where it has never been,
and never will be.
