If ego falls away,
and I am no one,
what am I then?

Alive and human,
I am a member
of Earthâ€™s family,
a cell in the body
of our Mother.

Like a drop of rain,
falling in a forest,
I coud nurture
all that grows.

Or,
like a cancer,
I could suck the life
out of all around me,
claiming everything
for myself.


This is the choice life gives me:
to give up my reign
in my little kingdom,
and join a much greater one.
