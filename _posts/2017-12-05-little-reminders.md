In the course of time,
things fail.

Old cars 
need new parts;
spare tires are only
"Temporary".

Eyes grow dimmer,
limbs grow achy.

Each of these changes
can be dealt with,
one at a time,
if we can accept
the inevitability 
of change.

In the end,
everything 
is temporary, 
and everything
is manageable.
