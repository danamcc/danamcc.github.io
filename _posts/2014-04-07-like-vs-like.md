title: Like vs. "Like"
category: life

I used to like a lot of things,
And I suppose that I still do,
But to "Like" something on Facebook
Has become my bugaboo.

Most things I like don't haunt me,
As Facebook "Likes" will do,
Spawning like a million fish,
As more messages accrue.

So please don't be offended,
Or look at me askew,
If, in my desperation,
I decline to just  "Like" you!
