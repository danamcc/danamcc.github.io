I have seen glimpses
of the buddha in me.

Sometimes,
an ancient teaching,
sent through the ages
by the kindness
of countless caring souls,
pries me open,
illuminating the darkness
of my mind’s worst imaginings.

And sometimes,
the light of this world
peaks through my ruminations,
splashing the colors
of life’s abundance
across my inner shadows.

These are gifts
not to be taken for granted,
not as rewards bestowed,
but as part of nature’s bounty,
free to be discovered.

I am grateful
for this chance to look.
