title: Suffering and Peace
category: life

All our stories of suffering  
grow like pearls around our pain.

Inside each one  
is a moment denied,  
encysted in the past.

If, in the light of seeing,  
the pearl dissolves,  
a grain of being is released,  
a moment once frozen in time.

Beyond that moment,  
there is peace.
