The mind
Is a priority machine.

Idle for a moment,
it will find an image to follow,
a call for what's next.

Either we awaken to that moment,
choosing a path that calls
from our heart and soul,
or we slip back,
along the track of unconsciousness,
sliding,
again and again,
through who we were,
unaware of who we are,
and who we can become.
