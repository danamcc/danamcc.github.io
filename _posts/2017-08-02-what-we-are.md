There are no assholes 
in this world,
unless we are all assholes.

We are what we are labelled,
by ourselves and by others,
or we are pure spirit,
hidden beneath our labels.

In the world of ego, 
we are separated 
by our struggles to be right,
combatting all the others
who, by their very differences,
seem always to be wrong.

But in the world of spirit,
right and wrong 
are only fever visions;
our separation,
just a bad dream.

Beyond these delusions,
we are the same,
in our suffering and our joy,
or we are nothing at all
but smoke,
dissipating with the wind.
