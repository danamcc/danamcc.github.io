What opens the heart?
What penetrates the shield of thought,
The armor of story?

What lets us stand naked,
Open and vulnerable,
Standing on nothing,
Floating in everything?

Love unreasoning 
Rips the curtain.
Light shines through, 
If only for a moment.

---

In the river of everything,
"I" bumps into "I"',
Melting into unity,
Melding in the moment.

Then the waters rush,
As entropy tugs,
And each "I" re-blooms
Into separateness.

Then, 
And then,
The dance continues,
And continues.
