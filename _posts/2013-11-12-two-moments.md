What opens the heart?  
What penetrates the shield of thought, Â 
The armor of story?

What lets us stand naked,  
Open and vulnerable, 
Standing on nothing,  
Floating in everything?

love unreasoning rips the curtain.  
Light shines through, if only for a moment.

In the river of everything,  
"I" bumps into "I"',  
Melting into unity,  
Melding in a moment.

Then the waters rush,  
As entropy tugs,  
And each "I" re-blooms  
Into separateness.

Then, and then,
The dance continues,
And continues.
