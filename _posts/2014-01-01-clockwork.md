In your clockwork world,  
How simple is the swaying of our hearts,  
delimited,  
finely tuned,  
bound by perfection?

What gives life to this exquisite mechanism,  
its animal breath subdued,  
its wild heart tamed  
to a medicated rhythm?

Where is love,  
messy and alive,  
pregnant and imperfect,  
in your clockwork world?
