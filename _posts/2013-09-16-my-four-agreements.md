title: My Four Agreements (with gratitude to Don Miguel Ruiz)
category: life

In each moment,
In my thoughts and my words,
I am expressing myself
With compassion and integrity.

In each moment,
I am accepting that every person
Is simply expressing their own reality,
And I will not take anything personally.

In each moment,
I am letting go of my assumptions,
And seeing the world with new eyes.

In each moment,
I acknowledge that I'm
Doing the best I can,
Warts and all.

In each moment,
I am stepping
Into a new dream.
