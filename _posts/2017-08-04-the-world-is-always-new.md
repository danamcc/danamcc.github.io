The world is always new,
regardless of how we see it.

Facing the familiar,
we tend to see 
what we have already seen,
like a blur of fading photos,
the differences between them
unseen, inconsequential.

What we miss
is the flow of time,
the ceaseless changes
that animate everything,
the constant shifting
of all around us
and inside us.

Why do we long
for these static, frozen images,
while life, in it's full glory,
dances so dynamically
around us?
