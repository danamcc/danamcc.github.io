As I walk this earth
as a human being,
there are things
I've been given,
for as long as I'm here.

I have a body,
but I am not my body.

I have a mind, 
but I am not my mind;
not my thoughts,
my feelings,
my dreams,
or my fears.

I am what comes
before these,
and what lasts
beyond them.

I am life flowing,
and its grateful witness.
