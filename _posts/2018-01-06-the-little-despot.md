_Sure, our minds can be useful, but they can also turn against us, 
when we let them take over our sense of who we are._

Your mind will tell you
that it has an answer for everything,
that thinking is the best path
to knowing and understanding.

It is the little despot
that schemes to rule your consciousness,
interrupting the flow of experience
with a constant flow of analysis.

It will distract you, if it can,
from the simple epiphanies 
that come from simply listening, 
looking, and feeling,
and accepting the gifts 
of natural knowing.
