_Thinking can be useful, but it can also turn against you, 
when you let it commandeer your sense of who you are:_

Your mind will tell you
that it has an answer for everything,
that thinking is the best path
to knowing and understanding.

It is the little despot
that schemes to rule your consciousness,
interrupting the flow of experience
with its constant stream of analysis.

It will distract you, if you let it,
from the little epiphanies 
that come from simply listening, 
simply looking, simply feeling,
and accepting the bounty 
of spontaneous knowing.
