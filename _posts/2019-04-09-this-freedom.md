_When we are open to them, life is full of reminders that we are not machines, that we always have a choice of how we will or won't respond in any situation. Therein lies our freedom!_
​
Once again,
you have "pushed my button"
(or so my thoughts
would tell me).
​
And so,
I would have to respond,
to push back at you,
if my thoughts were true,
if that button were real.
​
But as I watch this parade
of thoughts and feelings,
I am standing aside,
as if on the shore
of a roiling stream,
and I am choosing
not to jump in.
​
Thank you for this reminder,
that I always have this freedom,
to engage or not engage,
regardless of what you do!
