Time spins on,  
and the sun sinks below the sky,  
semaphoring, brightly, in the windows,  
and then dusk wheels in,  
pulling the night behind it.

A bigger wheel turns,  
and trees lose their coat of green,  
flashing into brilliance,   
then fading to brown.

And life rolls on,  
little wheels, big wheels,  
each moment ripening  
and falling away,  
giving way to the next,  
a timeless dance of becoming,  
ending,   
becoming.
