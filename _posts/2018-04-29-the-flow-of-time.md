title: The Flow of Time

The past is not a place -
it is a dream, 
of moments long gone,
a stream of memories
shifting and fading,
drifting like smoke
through our thoughts.

And likewise,
neither is there a future,
outside of our dreams and fears,
which flow, mirror-like,
away from the stream
of remembrance.

There is only one place
that is not a dream,
and that is where
we are now,
living and breathing,
poised in time,
and beyond it.
