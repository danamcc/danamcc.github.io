I am not my name,
or how I got here,
or who I think I am.

Without my mind’s
imaginings,
I am a point
of consciousness,
in space and time,
a tiny lense
the universe
peers through,
like a facet
of an insect’s eye,
a neuron
in a Greater Mind.

Like every living being,
I am a pulse
of awareness,
an atom
in a matrix
of infinite light.
