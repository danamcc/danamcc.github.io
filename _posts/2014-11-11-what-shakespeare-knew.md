We are all actors,
acting in our own plays.

The world is our stage,
the things and people in it,
our props.

How easily we forget
that we write every scene,
that the events unfolding
are our own dream.

Oh, to awaken
in the act of acting,
and see an infinity
of possible dreams,
each one ripe
to step into.
