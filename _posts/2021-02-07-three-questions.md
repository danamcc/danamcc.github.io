What if each of us
let the house of cards
that is our ego
tumble under its own weight, 
or be blown apart
by the winds of change,
until we are revealed,
naked 
in our true nature,
like snowflakes 
in a snowstorm,
each as important
or unimportant
as the next,
each one
an expression
of the all?

___


Why are we blinded
by our own uniqueness,
numb to the warm embrace
of everything we are a part of,
that is a part of us?

___


When will we tire
of building ourselves up,
and let ourselves relax
into the beautiful chaos
of life?
