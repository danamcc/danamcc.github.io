Love is a work in progress.

Time and again,  
we bang our heads  
against the hard skulls  
of our egos.

Sometimes the pain  
sends us inward,  
retreating into fear  
and isolation.

And sometimes,  
we reach out,  
beyond safety,  
beyond reason,  
to embrace  
what is bigger   
than ourselves.
