This is the fulcrum,
This moment,
As was every old moment,
And as every new moment will be.

THIS and THIS and THIS,
Flow endlessly,
Always in balance,
Turning points in a sea
Of endless choice.

In the eye of experience,
The river roars past the leaf,
The sky soars past the bird,
Always alive in stillness,
And always,
also, moving.
