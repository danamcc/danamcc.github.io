Life,   
unimpeded,   
dances endlessly,  
each moment perfect,  
in dynamic balance.  
  
Accepting its flow,  
we share its power,  
as a conscious partner.  
  
Resisted,  
being’s boundless energy  
winds down to nothing,  
dead and frozen,  
or spins off  
into chaos.  
  
In every instant  
is a seed,  
a quantum lever,  
the mind’s fulcrum choice;  
to ride the wave,  
or tumble   
in its wake.
