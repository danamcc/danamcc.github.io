Life,   
unimpeded,   
dances endlessly,  
each moment perfect,  
in dynamic balance.  
  
Accepting its flow,  
we share its power,  
as conscious partners.  
  
Resisted,  
being’s boundless energy  
winds down to nothing,  
dead and frozen,  
or spins off  
into chaos.  
  
In every instant  
is a seed,  
a quantum lever,  
the mind’s fulcrum:  
a choice    
to ride the wave,  
or tumble   
in its wake.
