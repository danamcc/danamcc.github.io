Freedom
is a beautiful dream.

Maybe there has never been
a land of liberty
in the world outside, 
but there may always be one 
in the world inside our souls. 

Freedom is a beautiful dream.

It is the dream
that points the way
to being a better human,
living in a better world.

It is a dream worth having.

And it is a dream worth living.
