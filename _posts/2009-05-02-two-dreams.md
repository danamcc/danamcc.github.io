What if you turned to me, in the middle of the night,  
Your arm a gentle snake wrapping around me;  
And your fingers brushed my penisâ€™ flesh,  
Warming, swollen into wakefulness;  
What if your breath caught in the back of my neck,  
Rising, sighing;  
And what if I turned to you,  
My waking lips finding you.

In this dream, I am inside you,  
Gently sliding,  
Drifting with you.

And, in this other dream, you are asleep beside me.  
We drift, side by side,  
Dream next to dream,  
Soul next to soul,  
Floating, peaceful.
