All too often,
when emotions swamp us,
we swim in a soup
of fear and anger,
careening off each other 
like billiard balls,
in wild trajectories
of upset and judgement.

Strangled by ego,
tangled by myopia,
our paths of right and wrong
veer randomly away
from the simple path
of understanding.

From our common source,
we stray into a tangled jungle
of opinions and indignation,
a thicket of division.

How easily we forget,
when pride consumes us,
where we came from:
we are one family, 
one mind.
