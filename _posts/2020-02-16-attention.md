In every moment
is the chance
to pay attention.

Attention
allows intention,
which allows choice.

Without them,
we become machines,
playing out old programs,
at the mercy of the patterns
of our past.

We are not fully alive
until we pay attention
to the life within us
and all around us;
and every moment
is a chance
to pay attention.
