There are gifts 
we take for granted
when they linger 
from day to day.

We only see
what's just been given,
or what has just 
been taken away.

We are blinded
by the sameness
of what stays with us
by and by.

Until these gifts
are torn away,
and, in our grief,
we wonder why.

But there are those
who always see these gifts,
who see each day
with grateful eyes;
they are the ones
whose vision guides us
and they are the angels
in our lives.
