﻿There was a time  
when you   
were the gateway  
to my Self.  
  
  
Loving you,   
and being loved,  
opened doors  
to the world outside  
and the world inside.  
  
  
Now,  
as time has passed,  
you’re gone from this world,  
but the doors remain open.  
  
  
Looking back,  
I see the path we shared,  
leading to this here and now.  
  
  
From this place of gratitude,  
complete in this moment,  
I see an open road,  
gleaming with possibility.
