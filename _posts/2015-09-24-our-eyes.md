Our eyes  
are the eyes  
of Spirit,  
born to see itself.  
  
But  
encumbered in flesh,  
yoked to a primate brain,  
our vision narrows,  
until only what is wanted,  
or what is feared,   
is seen.  
  
Yet   
there is a seed  
in every mind,  
a vault   
bigger than ourselves  
that holds  
it's own heritage,  
a gateway  
to what birthed us,  
a path back home.  
  
- D. McCurdy
