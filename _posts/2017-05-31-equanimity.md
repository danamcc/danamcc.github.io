Equanimity
is not indifference.

It is the desire
to experience life as it is,
not as we might wish it to be.

It is openness to everything,
without the need to grasp,
or push away.

It is the opposite of indifference,
which is a kind of death while living,
a blindness to all we could experience
if we enjoyed the flow of all life's wonders
without expectation,
and without fear.
