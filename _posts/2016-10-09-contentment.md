ï»¿Well fed,
well rested,
and reasonably safe,
an animal is content.

But we,
with infinite imagination,
can find a million things to want,
a million things to fear.

What drives us,
in our fevered minds,
to conjure a world
so lacking,
and so fraught,
when we could be resting
in the serenity
of enough?
