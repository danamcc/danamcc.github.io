What can the mind do
when it isn't thinking?

It can throw open
the shutters of the world,
drinking in its sights,
its sounds and feelings,
breathing in its energy,
luxuriating in the richness
of each moment.

It is either the narrator
of its own story,
aggrieved or triumphant,
or it is the grateful witness
of this world's bounty.
