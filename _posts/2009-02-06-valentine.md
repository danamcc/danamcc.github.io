Well, we may not be Valentines
(because we aren’t lovers),
But I am very fond of you
(and there’s lots of ground that covers!);

Through all these years of knowing you,
Through growing, and through sharing,
I’ve come to marvel that there are
So many ways of caring.

---

I have lusted after you, it’s true,
And harboured many dreams,
But I’ve grown to hold our friendship now
In a different light, it seems.

To see your spirit deepening,
To watch your courage soaring,
Enriches what I feel for you
(in a way that’s never boring!)

---

Yes, we’ve had our ups and downs,
And our path has not been clear,
Yet a spirit lives beneath all that
That I hold very dear.

So, whatever else may be the case,
I know that I love you,
And I’m sending you this wish, my friend -
Happy Valentine’s to you!
