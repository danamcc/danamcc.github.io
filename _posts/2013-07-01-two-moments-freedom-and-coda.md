To fly like the clouds,
amorphous, rootless,
sailing in the sun and wind,
drifting in and out of being.

________

I look down, 
to catch this moment in words;
I look up, 
and the bright magic has left the sky,
leaving a darker beauty, 
painful to see,
a poem that does not want 
to be written;
and still the clouds roll on,
like the sea,
like the earth,
like me.
