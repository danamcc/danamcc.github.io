To fly like the clouds,
Amorphous, rootless,
Sailing in the sun and wind,
Drifting in and out of being.

________

I look down, to catch this moment in words;
I look up, and the bright magic has left the sky,
Leaving a darker beauty, painful to see,
A poem that does not want to be written;
And still the clouds roll on,
Like the sea,
Like the earth,
Like me.
