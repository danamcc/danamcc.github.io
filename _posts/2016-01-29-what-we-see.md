When we look at the world,  
much of what is seen  
are the artifacts of seeing,  
glitches in the operating system  
of our minds.  
  
Filtered and quantized,  
we see only what we expect,  
what we can understand.  
  
We see as through   
a scanner, darkly,  
filling in the broken pixels  
with memory,  
hope, and fear.  
  
But to see  
without the mindâ€™s intrusions  
is to see,  
perhaps in glimpses,  
what is real.
