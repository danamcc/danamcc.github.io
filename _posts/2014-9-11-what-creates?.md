What creates?

How is what the painter paints  
Different from these clouds,  
Brushed across the sky?  

How are the intricate folds of foliage  
Different from the strokes of an artist's pen,  
Etched, line by line, into paper?  

Are these not the works of One artist,  
Manifest in everything?  

What are these words,  
But the universe telling itself  
Of its own beauty?
