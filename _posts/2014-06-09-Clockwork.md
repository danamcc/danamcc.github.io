In your clockwork world,  
How simple does the swaying of our hearts become,  
delimited,  
finely tuned,  
bound by perfection?

What gives life to this exquisite mechanism,  
its animal breath subdued,  
its wild heart tamed  
to a therapeutic rhythm?

Where is love,  
messy and alive,  
pregnant and imperfect,  
in your clockwork world?
