There will come a time
when I am dead and gone,
and all that will remain of me
are the memories I leave behind.

As I sit at this keyboard,
on the shore of a digital sea,
I pause, like a castaway,
as I toss my bits and bytes
into these streams and tides of data,
and consider:
is THIS how I would choose
to be remembered?
