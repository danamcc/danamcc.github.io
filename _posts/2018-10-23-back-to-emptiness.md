Sometimes I hear arguments
inside my head,
and I wonder:
"Who are these people,
and how did they get in here?"

They are only passing thoughts,
of course,
but, over time, 
they grow louder,
more solid and real,
the more I  believe in them.

When I stop to watch and listen,
I am like the viewer 
of a pointless movie,
wondering how and why
I gave my time and energy
to such flimsy fictions.

And when I see myself
watching from a peaceful place,
I lose interest in their noisy clamor,
and they seem to fade away,
back to the emptiness
from which they came.
