As I stand here 
with my neighbors,
my brothers and my sisters, 
we stand in silent witness
to a status quo 
which we can no longer 
accept or tolerate.

Standing in silence, 
my heart opens 
to the pain we all share, 
and the compassion 
that we may share as well,
if we are resolute 
in our intention for change.

Standing here,
I am reminded 
that I am a member 
of the human race, 
and hiding 
is no longer an option.

My aging body 
said it could not kneel 
for a whole nine minutes, 
but I asked it to, and it did.

“Now you know 
what nine minutes feels like”, 
a fellow next to us said,
as I remembered George Floyd,
who had no choice
about how he spent
his last nine minutes.
