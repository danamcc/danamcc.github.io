Why does change
amaze and confuse us,
sometimes fill us 
with discomfort
and fear?

Is it because
what we see before us
refuses to match
the pictures 
we hold so tightly
in our minds?

What stubborn perversity
keeps us glued 
to yesterday's images,
while life's immediacy
plays out in front of us?

What futile hope of comfort
persuades us
to ignore life's challenges
and its joyous surprises
in favor of a certainty
which is only imagined?
