How safe it must feel,
to the wounded girl within,
to withhold your love
from those who love you,
as your father once, perhaps,
withheld his love from you.

Our love is not perfect,
nor was his,
but perhaps, one day,
you will forgive us all,
and forgive yourself,
and let that little girl
step out again,
wrapped in your own love,
to love, and be loved,
as she will.
