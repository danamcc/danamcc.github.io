How safe it must feel,  
to the wounded girl inside you  
to withhold your love  
from the men who love you,  
as your father, once,  
withheld his love from you.

Our love is not perfect,   
nor was his,  
but perhaps, one day,  
you will forgive us all,  
and forgive yourself,  
and let that little girl  
step out again,  
wrapped in your own love,   
to love, and be loved,  
as she will.
