Regal and composed,
he sits serenely,
bound and adorned,
inured to his captivity.

He is the wild 
and the sacred
in all of us,
patiently waiting 
for his freedom,
ready for release.

It is we, in fact,
who have bound him,
who have bound ourselves.

And these chains and fences
are merely figments,
held in place by our beliefs,
until, by Grace,
they may dissolve 
in the breeze of awareness.

Grace
is what flows through us
when we get out of our own way.
