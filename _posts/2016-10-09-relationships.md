We have pushed each other’s buttons,  
touched each other’s wounds,  
so many times,  
until there comes a time   
to ask forgiveness,  
and to forgive.  
  
We have blundered  
into relationship,  
craving surcease,  
not seeing the other’s pain.  
  
Seeing this,   
Is it kinder to walk away,  
or to face each other,  
raw and open,  
meeting in fellowship?  
  
The answer  
may be hard to know,  
but it may be found  
through courage   
and compassion.
