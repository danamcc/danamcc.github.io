title: Out of Emptiness

I was born out of emptiness, 
and to emptiness I will return.

The more I look into that darkness, 
the more I see the birthplace of everything, 
where everything must also return. 

And when that day arrives, 
I need not fear falling 
into some strange, forbidding place,
for I will be going home.
