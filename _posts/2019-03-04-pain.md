There are people 
who are hurting so badly,
that all they can do
is lash out at other people.

They cannot bear their own pain,
or tolerate the possibility
that is was, to some degree,
their own creation.

We could hear their attacks
as cries for help,
if we were willing to let go 
of our own pain
at being attacked.

Why do we let pain 
separate us,
when it is, 
fundamentally,
something we all share?
