Nothing is entirely bad,
Or entirely good.

All we ever see
are the mind's snapshots,
momentary glimpses
in a river of change,
filtered through our fears,
and hopes,
and assumptions..

Joy and suffering,
wanted and unwanted,
are part of a flow,
morphing and merging
as event follows event,
perception follows perception.

All we ever know
is that we are alive
and free to choose
in this moment,
free to look anew, 
free to act.
