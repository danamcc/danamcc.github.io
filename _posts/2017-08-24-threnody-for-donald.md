There are tortured souls 
who, in their imagined weakness,
only torture themselves;
and there are tortured souls 
who, in their imagined strength,
torture us all.

So, as we watch a fellow human 
slowly sinking into the depths 
of his own depravity,
how should we name what we see?

If it were on Netflix or HBO,
we would call it entertainment;
on CNN, or in the NY Times,
we call it news.

How have we come,
with so little empathy 
or understanding,
to accept these as equivalent,
as if our worst imaginings,
delightful as they may be
as mere fantasy,
were acceptable as reality,
to be lived in 
without complaint,
as if this were only
another form 
of entertainment?
