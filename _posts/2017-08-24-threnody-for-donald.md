There are tortured souls who,
in their imagined weakness,
only torture themselves;
and there are tortured souls who,
in their imagined strength,
torture all of us as well.

So, as we watch a fellow human 
slowly sinking 
into the depths 
of his own depravity,
how should we name what we see?

On Netflix or HBO,
we would call it entertainment;
on CNN, or in the NY Times,
we call it news.

How have we come
to accept these as equivalents,
with so little empathy 
or understanding,
as if our worst imaginings
(delightful as they seem,
as mere fantasies)
were acceptable as a reality
to actually live in, 
without complaint,
as if it were merely
a form of entertainment?
