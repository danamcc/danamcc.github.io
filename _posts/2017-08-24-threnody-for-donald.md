There are tortured souls who,
in their own imagined weakness,
only torture themselves;
and there are tortured souls who,
in their imagined strength,
torture all of us as well.

So, as we watch a fellow human 
slowly sinking 
into the depths of his own depravity,
how should we name what we see?

As we watch it on Netflix or HBO,
we call it entertainment;
on CNN, or in the NY Times,
we would call it news.

How have we come
to accept these as equivalent,
with so little empathy or understanding,
as if our worst imaginings
(delightful as they are,
if only as our fantasies)
were acceptable as a reality
which we would live in, 
without complaint,
as if it were merely
a form of entertainment?
