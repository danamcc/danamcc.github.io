There are tortured souls who,
in their own imagined weakness,
torture only themselves;
and there are tortured souls who,
in their imagined strength,
torture all of us as well.

So, as we watch a fellow human 
slowly sinking 
into the depths 
of his own depravity,
how should we name what we see?

If watched on Netflix or HBO,
we would call it entertainment;
on CNN, or in the NY Times,
we would call it news.

How have we come
to accept these as equivalent,
as if our worst imaginings
(delightful as they are,
if only as fantasies)
were acceptable as a reality
which we would live in willingly,
as if it were merely
a form of entertainment?
