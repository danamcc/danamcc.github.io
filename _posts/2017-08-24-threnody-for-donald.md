There are tortured souls 
who, in their dream of weakness,
only torture themselves;
but there are tortured souls 
who, in their dream of strength,
torture us all.

And so, as we watch a fellow human 
sinking slowly into the depths 
of his own depravity,
how do we name what we see?

If it were on Netflix or HBO,
we would call it entertainment;
on CNN, or in the NY Times,
we call it news.

How have we come,
with so little empathy, 
so little understanding,
to accept these as equivalent,
as if our worst imaginings,
delightful as they might be
as mere fantasy,
were acceptable as reality,
to be lived in without complaint,
as if this were only
another form of entertainment?
