I can look at your picture now,  
and see a beautiful friend,  
without the haze of hurt and anger  
obscuring it.  
  
I see a gentle soul   
trying her best,  
to learn and grow,  
with an open heart.  
  
I can sense the struggle,  
as if it were my own,  
to move through pain,  
towards equanimity  
and understanding.  
  
I feel a fellow traveler,  
moving on her own path,  
as I move on mine,  
sometimes intersecting,  
sometimes veering away,  
somehow connected in Spirit.
