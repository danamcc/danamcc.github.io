I have an angry monkey
careening through my mind,
shouting judgements
from a forest of prejudices,
excited and incensed
by the slightest stimuli.

Should I hunt him down?
That would only increase
his frenzy!

Better to befriend him,
to offer him the calm
and the patient compassion
of a Mother Monkey.

What else 
does any creature need,
except the comfort of acceptance,
and the confidence of being loved?
