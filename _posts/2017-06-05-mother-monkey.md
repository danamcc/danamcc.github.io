I have an angry monkey
careening through my mind,
shouting judgements
from a forestful 
of preconceptions,
excited and incensed
by the slightest stimuli.

Should I hunt him down,
or would that only increase
his frenzy?

Better to befriend him,
to offer him the calm
and the patient compassion
of a mother monkey.

What else, indeed, 
does any creature need,
except the comfort of acceptance,
and the strength of being loved?
