I am a wave
in the sea of Spirit,
and I stand 
with a foot in each.

With one eye,
I see the little world
I call “my life”.

With the other,
I see everything
that is “not me”,
flowing around me
and through me.

When I close my eyes,
relax my stance,
I float away
from my little world,
awash in the flow
that gives me life.
