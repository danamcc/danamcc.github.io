In this world,  
there are no evil people,  
but yet,  
much evil is done.  
  
Through the myth of "I",  
the wedge of fear,  
we deny the bonds of nature,  
and stand alone,  
suffering in our ignorance.  
  
To strike out against another  
is only possible  
when we forget our birthright,  
that we were always,  
and always will be,  
One.  
  
- D. McCurdy
