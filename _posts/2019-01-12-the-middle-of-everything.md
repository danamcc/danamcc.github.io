As I awaken, once again,
from the dream 
that sometimes seems 
to be my life,
the deluge of daily details
that parade across my mind,

I fall, once again,
into the sea of the senses,
awash in the brilliance
of what I see,
and hear, and feel
around me.

There is a world outside,
when I'm not lost in dreams,
that speaks louder than any thought,
and the world inside reopens,
merging in intimate embrace 
with what is beyond it, 
until there is no inside,
no outside.

These are the moments
that cannot be bought
with thought or effort,
when everything falls away
except being alive,
and I find myself 
in the middle 
of everything.
