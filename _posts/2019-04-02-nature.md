A lawn of astroturf,
a lawn of grass and weeds;
what is the difference? 

We have learned
to wrestle nature to the ground, 
learned how to imitate it,
while slowly forgetting 
how to live in it.

Our lives have always
been a part of it,
whether we have known it
or not.

As much as we include it
in our lives,
we remember 
what we're made of.

As much as we exclude it,
we impoverish ourselves,
exiled to a prison
we built ourselves.
