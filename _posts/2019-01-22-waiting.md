Everywhere I look,
I see people waiting.

Some are waiting for death,
or for their next meal.

Others are waiting 
for their next success,
or their next big romance.

Whatever any of us have,
somehow it never seems 
to be enough.

I have waited too long,
for things that did or didnâ€™t happen,
and now I am tired of waiting.

I have this breath,
I have this moment,
and that is enough.
