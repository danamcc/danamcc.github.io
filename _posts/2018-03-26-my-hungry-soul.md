Sometimes my mind
is like a swamp,
alive with swarming thoughts,
like a thousand shiny lures,
bait for my hungry soul.

And sometimes,
a glint of light
reveals my hunger itself 
as just a thought,
and all those tasty,
tantalizing morsels
recede into my imagination,
and I am free to swim again
in the clear water
that is my real home.
