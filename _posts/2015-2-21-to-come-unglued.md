title: To Come Unglued
category: life

If I were to come unglued,
what would I be,
unconstrained by thought,
unrestricted by convention,
unbound?

If we allow what holds us together
to dissolve,
what remains?

Inside the shell of reason
is energy unfettered,
like the dance of atoms,
life expressing itself,
flowing freely,
waiting to be born.
