What’s so special 
about the present moment
is that It’s all there ever really is.
​
All our other moments
are just ideas,
thoughts about moments passed,
or moments yet to be.
​
Endless hours roll by
while we ruminate
about what happened,
or what might happen,
while what IS happening
passes by us, 
unnoticed.
​
This is the tragedy of our lives:
that the more time we spend
assembling and assessing
our lives’ stories,
the less time we spend 
actually living.
