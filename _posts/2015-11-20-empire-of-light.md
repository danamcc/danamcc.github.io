Outside my window,  
as I look out  
across the street,  
spreads an Empire of Light,  
as if Magritteâ€™s vision  
has come to life  
before me.

And I wonder:  
is this  
like the painting,  
or is the painting  
like this?

The riddle of perception  
lies in all our art,  
as it does  
in the world around us,  
teasing our senses,  
enlivening our vision,  
awakening wonder.
