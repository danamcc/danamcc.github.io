As we look out at the world,  
how much of what we see  
is blurred and clouded   
by the artifacts of seeing?  
  
Through the mindâ€™s eye,  
filtered and quantized,  
do we only see   
what we expect,  
or can understand?  
  
Do we look as through   
a scanner, darkly,  
filling in teach missing pixel  
with memory,  
hope, or fear?  
  
Or can we look more deeply,  
seeing HOW we see,  
the forest AND the trees,  
the picture and the pixels?  
  
Only through this inner seeing  
can we learn to see   
both worlds,  
the world inside,  
and the world around us.
