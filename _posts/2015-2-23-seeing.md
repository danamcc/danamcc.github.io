Through these lenses,  
a million jewels dance,  
in the snow,   
the ice,   
the water,  
polarized   
into vibrant life.

In other light,  
they would fade   
into nothing,  
hidden   
in obscurity.

What other jewels   
lie shrouded  
by the lense of seeing,  
to be discovered only   
as we learn to look   
with different eyes?

For each way of seeing,  
there is a new universe  
sparkling into being,  
as our eyes and minds   
grant it life.
