When we talk to ourselves, who talks to who, and who is it that hears this conversation?  
Who is it  that can observe all this going on, and wonder: who are  all these “I”s?  
Perhaps, they are all just smoke  and mirrors, eddies in the flow  of consciousness, the river of "I am".  
Evanescent, like rain drops, forming and dissolving, each one catches the light for a moment, and then disappears.
