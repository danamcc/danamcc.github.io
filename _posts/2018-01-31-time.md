_Thank you, John!_

Time is a concept
by which we measure
our gain.

I don’t believe in “better”;
I don’t believe in “worse”;
I just believe in “is”.

And if, beyond our fevered thoughts,
there is no past or future,
no yardstick to judge the present with,
then we are left with the freedom
to accept and embrace it,
with nothing to compare it to, 
as the only reality
there ever is.
