There are two approaches 
to viewing our human experience:
how foolishly we deal with the challenges of life,
or how difficult and painful it is to face change.

If we could see these as the same,
perhaps we could appreciate 
life's true complexity,
with a bit less judgement,
and a bit more compassion.
