We have been given all the wisdom 
we will ever need, 
but we have not listened well.

So many have pointed the way, 
but we have not looked
for ourselves,
to see what they were seeing.

We have lulled ourselves 
with dreams of wanting, 
dreams of avoidance, 
so we do not see
what's right in front of us.

We do not see 
that there is nowhere to go
from where we are,  
that the Paradise 
we have been promised 
is already all around us, 
ready to be seen,
if we would open our eyes.
