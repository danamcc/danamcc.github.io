We have been given all the wisdom 
we will ever need, 
but we have not taken it
to heart.

So many have pointed the way, 
but we have not looked
with our own eyes,
to see what they were seeing.

We have lulled ourselves 
with dreams of wanting, 
dreams of avoidance, 
blinding ourselves
to what's right in front of us.

So we do not see 
that there is nowhere to stand
except where we are,  
that the Paradise 
we have been promised 
is all around us, 
ready to be seen,
if we would open our eyes.
