_In gratitude to the luminous spirit 
and profound teaching of Thích Nhất Hạnh_
 
Stuck in traffic, 
as a seed of irritation
germinated in my thoughts,
I asked myself 
"What would Thay  do?"

I remembered, then,
that I had been given a gift, 
the time to simply breathe,
relaxing, doing nothing, 
as I let the sights 
and sounds of the day 
wash over me,
bathing in the moment,
grateful and content.
