Each person 
has their own religion,
which we could call 
"The Way I See the World".

It has only
one priest,
one disciple,
one church -
the Church of Me.

It seeks acolytes
offering agreement,
saying “You are right!
This is how the world is!”

We each become god
in our own little church,
but we are lonely gods,
separated from each other
by our godly doctrines.

We stand alone
with our little truths,
forsaking the big Truth
for the thrill of being right.
