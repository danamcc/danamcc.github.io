title: leaves in a stream

Our bodies sail through life
like leaves in a stream.

They float with it
because they are
not separate from it.

They are part of the stream,
but in a different form.

And who rides along,
seeing this flow,
often afraid
that we cannot control it?

What stream of thoughts
do we also ride on,
likewise powerless
to control them?

We are the pilots,
spirits riding energy,
but mostly we watch,
and, in moments
of epiphany,
we may nudge ourselves
into a different flow.
