The "me" I think I am
exists only in my memory,
a chain of thoughts
I have thought about myself.

It is the story strung together
from thoughts following thoughts,
until this train of thought 
seems to solidify 
into a sense of "me",
into an object 
of my experience.


How often I forget
that there is an "I"
who is witness to all this,
who sees these thoughts
come and go,
who sees everything
come and go,
welcoming 
each new experience,
needing no story,
no explanation.
