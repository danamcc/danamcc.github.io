title: The Magic of a Misty Moon

That smudge against the night
is probably the moon,
or maybe it is something 
far more mysterious,
perhaps a thing of myth.

I know it is the moon,
and yet its magic,
splashed across the sky, 
is not diminished 
by my knowing. 

What I experience
and what I know
are the stuff 
of two different worlds,
and that, in itself,
is the greater magic.
