When you look,
see!

When you hear,
listen!

When you pause in your thinking,
in any particular moment,
let the world pour into you;
there will always be beauty,
and always be magic
to be found.

Look up from your thoughts,
from your distractions 
and your fears,
and a universe of wonders
will reveal themselves!
