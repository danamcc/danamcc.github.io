When first I opened my heart to you,  
I was called by your beauty,  
By my desire.

Now my heart stays open,  
Because you are my friend,  
Truly a friend.

Always a mirror  
Of what I love in myself.

I was drawn to you  
Because of what I wanted.  
I love you now  
Because of what I am,  
What I am becoming.
