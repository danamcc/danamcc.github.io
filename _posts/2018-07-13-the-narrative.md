There are people around me
always longing 
to control the narrative.

And there is a voice in my head
that is always longing
to control the narrative.

All of us are caught
in a wild world web,   
clamoring with voices
all striving to be 
in control of the narrative.

And the narrative
is nothing but a lie,
a desparate fiction,
concealing our fear
that, without a narrative,
our lives would have no meaning.

And what if we are enough
without a narrative,
and we are entitled to be
just as we were born,
before there was a story,
when we were just ourselves,
content to be alive?
