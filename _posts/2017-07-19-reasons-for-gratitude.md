There are always reasons
for gratitude,
though they may not always 
be easy to find.

In the worst of times,
there is at least this breath,
this moment of life,
and an ever-present promise 
of change:
as the saying goes,
"This, too, shall pass!

And there are other times,
when joy does not leap 
out at us;
when we can look out
past our thoughts 
and preconceptions,
and find something, 
somewhere, 
beyond our usual seeing,
to inspire the joy
of simply being.
