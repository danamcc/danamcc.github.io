There are always reasons for gratitude,
though they are not always easy to find.

In the worst of times,
there is at least this breath,
this next moment of life,
and the ever-present promise of change,
that "this, too, shall pass".

And there are other times,
when joy seems absent,
when we can look out
past our thoughts 
and preconceptions,
past our usual awareness,
and find something, 
somewhere,
to inspire the joy
of simply being.
