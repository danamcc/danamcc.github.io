Vivid in the sun,  
Each building jumps out,  
As if in 3D,  
Popping out of the picture,  
Yearning for the eye.

The clouds paint nature's backdrop,  
Full of chaotic grandeur,  
A wild gumbo  
Of light and dark.

This is more than movie magic,  
Beyond what the mind imagines.  
This is the shock of awakening  
To the Real.
