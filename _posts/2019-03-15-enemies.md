Try as you might,
I will not be your enemy.

Little by little,
I am coughing up 
the poison pill 
you pushed at us,
resisting the pull
to swallow and choke on it.

It's bitterness
is almost sweet,
but not sweet enough
to hide its poison.

Addicted to its venom,
you have thrown your anguish at us
so we might drown in it,
as if to protect you
from drowning yourself.

I cannot relieve
your pain and anger;
I can only refrain
from giving in to it
and becoming a victim
myself.
