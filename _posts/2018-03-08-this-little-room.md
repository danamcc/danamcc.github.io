I've been hiding out
in a little room,
most of the time,
for most of my days.

I must have thought
I was safe in here,
that someone told me
I should stay inside.

I had forgotten
the vastness
outside these walls,
gotten used 
to how small,
how tight
it is in here.

I had forgotten
that this little room 
grew out of nothing,
like a cocoon
around my fears.

I had forgotten
that I was born
without it,
that it was my choice
to stay within it,
and that it is my choice
to leave.
